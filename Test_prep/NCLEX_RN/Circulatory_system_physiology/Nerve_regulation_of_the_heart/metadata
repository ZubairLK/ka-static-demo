Although your heart can beat independently, your nervous system is important as an external regulator. Your brain can tell your heart to speed up or slow down, depending on the scenario. For example, when youâ€™re falling asleep, your nervous system will cause your heart to slow down, and 8 hours later when your phone alarm goes off, your nervous system will speed up your heartbeat!  So even though your heart muscle beats by itself, the nerves can ramp up or down the speed.  Check out the videos to learn more about how the nerves help to regulate the heart.
