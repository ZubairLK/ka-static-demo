5D:  Aldol condensations are one of the most important, frequently seen reactions in biochemistry. In fact, the very first reaction of the Krebs (TCA) cycle is an aldol condensation in which acetyl CoA condenses with oxaloacetate, forming citrate. You will learn the mechanism of these reactions formed as we extend this concept to predict the products of aldol condensations.
