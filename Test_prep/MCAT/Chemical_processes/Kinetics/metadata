Chemical reactions are like an assembly line. The right parts have to come together at the right time in order to make the right product. How fast this can occur depends on the slowest step of the process. These videos show how and why different reactions occur at different speeds, and how catalysts - like enzymes in the body - can make reactions happen faster.
