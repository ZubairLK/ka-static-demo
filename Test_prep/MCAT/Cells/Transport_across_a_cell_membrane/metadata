2A: Each cell in your body has a “membrane potential.” Think of it like rolling a ball to the top of a hill - once the ball is at the top, it is smooth sailing down. Similarly, this electric membrane potential allows ions to flow down a gradient of electrical energy (the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside). We will discuss this concept as well as other mechanisms for movement of ions, water, and other molecules across cellular membranes.
