Recall from chemistry that electrons are transferred between atoms during redox reactions. When redox reactions occur on a conductive surface, the moving electrons can be collected as a current, with the voltage being dependent on the species used in reaction. Find out how batteries are made and the chemistry that makes them function by watching these videos.
