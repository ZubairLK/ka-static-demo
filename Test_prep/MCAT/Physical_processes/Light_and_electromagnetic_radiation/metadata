4D:  Believe it or not, light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, as evidenced by the concepts of polarization, interference, and the photon model. In this modern age of medicine, we have seen a rise in the clinical use of the laser (which actually stands for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). As we discuss theories outlined by geniuses like Max Planck several decades ago, you’ll discover how light rays interfere in double slit, single slit, and diffraction gratings.
