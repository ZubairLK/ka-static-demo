4A:  Apples would not fall without a force to propel them downward. These three laws described by the famous Englishman centuries ago still inform our understanding of the physical world today. When you push a patient’s bed down the halls of the hospital, you are providing a force in a direction. If we know the magnitude of the force we provide as well as the mass of the patient and the hospital bed,  we can calculate the acceleration of the patient and his bed using Newton’s Second law (F=ma).
