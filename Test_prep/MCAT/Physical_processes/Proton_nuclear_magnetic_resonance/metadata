Letâ€™s shift gears and take a peak at 1H-NMR. When you bring a magnet close to iron filings, the filings align with the applied field. The hydrogen atoms of molecules behave similarly under a strong magnetic field, but bounce back and radiate when the field is removed. in this section you will learn how to interpret the spectra created by proton NMR.
