4D: Without lenses, we would not be able to examine the layers of the skin or to observe the habits of the pink flamingo from a distance.  If you have ever used a microscope, binoculars, or a magnifying glass, you have benefited from the workings of a thin lens, which refracts rays of light as it passes through the medium. In these tutorials, youâ€™ll learn how to use ray tracings and the thin lens formula to predict the sizes and orientation of images created by thin lenses. We will apply these concepts to a discussion of the human eye.
