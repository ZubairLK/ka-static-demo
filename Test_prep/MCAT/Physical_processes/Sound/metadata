4D:Some sounds are loud (high amplitude) like someone yelling, while others are soft (low amplitude) like a whisper. Some sounds are low pitched (low frequency) like a fog-horn, while others are high-pitched (high frequency) like a pager. You may have even noticed that the pitch of an ambulance rises as it rushes towards you and drops as it moves away. This is the Doppler effect in action. Here you will learn about the basics of sound properties such as wavelength, frequency, and amplitude.
