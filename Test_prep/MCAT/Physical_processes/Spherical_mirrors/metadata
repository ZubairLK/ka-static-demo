4D: Have you ever been to a house of mirrors at a carnival, or maybe seen one in the movies? Curved mirrors are fun, and so is a description of their physics. Itâ€™s actually possible to roughly predict what an image produced by a mirror will look like using just pen and paper. You will discover the difference between real and virtual images as we draw ray tracing diagrams to show how images are formed by spherical mirrors.
