8A: Who exactly are we? How do we develop our morals and patterns of learning? What influences our behaviors in social situations? Physicians must have a keen understanding of their patientsâ€™ definitions of themselves in order to treat holistically. Over the past few centuries, several notable psychologists - from Freud to Erikson to Vygotsky - have attempted to answer these grand question. In this module you will explore some of their ideas surrounding the concept of self-identity as we delve into the different phases of our life as we transform from infants to teenagers to full-fledged adults.
