9B: There are many different ways of looking at a population. You can separate the population into different groups to view statistics. For instance, one may want to compare the efficacy of a drug in treating diabetics with congestive heart failure compared to diabetics without heart failure - these each form two separate populations of patients.  In this module, you will come to see how different populations interact and change over time.
