<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Culture/index.html>Culture</a></p><p>Why is it that in America it is acceptable to eat a quarter pound hamburger and guzzle down a large soft drink yet it is weird to eat a grasshopper? The answer is because of our culture. Culture varies across the world and provides rules for a society of people to live by. Here we explore what culture is and how it shapes our human experience.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Demographics/index.html>Demographics</a></p><p>9B: There are many different ways of looking at a population. You can separate the population into different groups to view statistics. For instance, one may want to compare the efficacy of a drug in treating diabetics with congestive heart failure compared to diabetics without heart failure - these each form two separate populations of patients.  In this module, you will come to see how different populations interact and change over time. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Social_structures/index.html>Social_structures</a></p><p>9A: Any group of people involved in interpersonal relationship is a society. How do we humans all live together in such highly populated cities? How does a society change? You will learn about some famous sociological theories which aim to address these important questions, from conflict theory and feminist theory to social constructionism.</p></div>
