7C: This is the most “meta” of all modules, in which you will learn about learning! Your environment has a huge impact on your future behavior, and your behavior itself has consequences on the environment. You will come to appreciate the mechanisms of classical and operant conditioning (and how you can apply these concepts to training your dog!). We will apply these to contemporary issues like the issue of violence in the media. As you go through this module, you will gain an understanding of how your brain retains new information.
