1B: Cells have many intricate mechanisms which regulate expression of genetic material - from transcription of RNA to translation of protein. At every point in this process, enzymes in your body can step in to modulate how much or how little RNA, or protein is produced from the genome. Sometimes, these genetic controls go awry, and so cells grow without inhibition - this is often how tumors develop, a pathogenic process we will also explore.
