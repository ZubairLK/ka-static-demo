3B: If you place your hand on your ribs and take a deep breath, youâ€™ll notice that your chest expands and your back straightens. As this occurs, air is rushing through your windpipe and branches off to either your left or right lung.

This rapid microscopic gas exchange allows oxygen to be taken up during inhalation as carbon dioxide leaves during exhalation.
