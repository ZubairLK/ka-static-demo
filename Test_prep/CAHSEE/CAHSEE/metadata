Sal working through the 53 problems from the practice test available at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/hs/documents/mathpractest.pdf for the CAHSEE (California High School Exit Examination).  Clearly useful if you're looking to take that exam.  Probably still useful if you want to make sure you have a solid understanding of basic high school math.
