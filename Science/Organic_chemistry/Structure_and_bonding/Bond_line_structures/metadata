Call them Bonds. Covalent Bonds. Smart chemists need time to stir (and shake) their solutions. In this tutorial, we will explain how chemists use bond-line structures as a form of organic shorthand to skip time-consuming carbon and hydrogen atoms labeling. Watch this tutorial so you too can be in the Dr. Know.
