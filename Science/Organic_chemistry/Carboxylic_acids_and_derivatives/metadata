Did you know that many fruit aromas including banana (isoamyl acetate) and pineapple (ethyl butanoate) come from molecules containing ester groups? These compounds can be synthesized from carboxylic acids using a reaction called Fischer esterification. We will be covering naming carboxylic acids, as well as the diverse chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides, amides, esters, and anhydrides.
