Many chemical reactions are reversible, and the forward and backward reactions can occur at the same time. When the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction, we call that a dynamic equilibrium. We will learn how equilibrium can be described by the equilibrium constant K, and how different factors than can affect the chemical equilibrium.
