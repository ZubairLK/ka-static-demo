We'll now explore two different ways of representing what elements are in a molecule: molecular and empirical formulas.  Molecular formulas actually represent the number of atoms in  a molecule while empirical formulas show us the ratio of the constituents based on experiments.  In order to help us connect these ideas, we'll also explore a quantity called the "mole".  Just as a "dozen" represents 12 of something, a "mole" represents  roughly 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 of something.  This will help us think about mass composition of molecules.
