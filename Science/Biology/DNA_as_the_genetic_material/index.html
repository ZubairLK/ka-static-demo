But scientists didnâ€™t always know this. In fact, for many years, researchers thought that protein would turn out to be the genetic material! Learn more about the properties of DNA and how it was identified as the hereditary molecule.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=DNA_replication/index.html>DNA_replication</a></p><p>When you make a copy of something, how perfect does the copy need to be? If that something is your DNA, the answer is, pretty perfect! Errors during DNA copying can lead to cancer and other health conditions. Learn how cells use a group of different enzymes to accurately copy their DNA, and how they detect and repair copying errors and DNA damage.</p></div>
