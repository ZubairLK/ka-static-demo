What are the consequences of genes being carried on chromosomes? Well, all sorts of interesting stuff! We can see sex linkage when genes are on X or Y chromosomes, genetic disorders when too few or too many chromosomes are inherited, and unusual inheritance patterns when our genes are in the chromosomes of mitochondria or chloroplasts.
