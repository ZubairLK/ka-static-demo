Probably quite a lot of things! At the cellular level, though, some of the key differences include a cell nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, which you have (and the bacterium lacks). Here, we'll look in detail at the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Introduction_to_cells/index.html>Introduction_to_cells</a></p><p>Start your cellular journey the right way: with some history and some microscopy! Here, we'll learn more about how cells were discovered, how they can be observed, and how big they are in comparison to other very small things.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Skill_check_Structure_of_a_cell/index.html>Skill_check_Structure_of_a_cell</a></p><p>Test your understanding of cell structure!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Tour_of_a_eukaryotic_cell/index.html>Tour_of_a_eukaryotic_cell</a></p><p>Join us on a voyage through some of the specialized compartments and structures of eukaryotic cells.

Here, we'll look at the extracellular matrix of animal cells and the cell wall of plant cells, as well as the junctions that hold cells together.</p></div>
