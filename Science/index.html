In this section of Khan Academy, you'll learn about the brain-bending vastness of time and space. We go from plate tectonics here on Earth to entire galaxies and beyond. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=AP_Physics_1/index.html>AP_Physics_1</a></p><p>An algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that explores topics such as Newtonian mechanics (including rotational motion); work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits. This course is followed shortly after with AP Physics 2, which we also support.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Health_and_medicine/index.html>Health_and_medicine</a></p><p>The medical world can be a confusing place. Patients, their families, and even students entering health fields might feel overwhelmed by the large vocabularies and complicated explanations. We hope to make understanding the medical world a bit easier. Look around!

Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have read or seen in any Khan Academy video.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=AP_Chemistry/index.html>AP_Chemistry</a></p><p>An introductory college-level chemistry course that explores topics such as atoms, compounds, and ions; chemical reactions and stoichiometry; ideal gases; chemical equilibrium; acids and bases; kinetics; thermodynamics; redox reactions and electrochemistry; and a whole lot more!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Biology/index.html>Biology</a></p><p>Life is beautiful! From atoms to cells, from genes to proteins, from populations to ecosystems, biology is the study of the fascinating and intricate systems that make life possible. Dive in to learn more about the many branches of biology and why they are exciting and important.

Covers topics seen in a high school or first-year college biology course.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Organic_chemistry/index.html>Organic_chemistry</a></p><p>Sal and Jay cover topics covered in college organic chemistry course.  Basic understanding of basic high school or college chemistry assumed (although there is some review).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Electrical_engineering/index.html>Electrical_engineering</a></p><p>Learn about electricity, circuit theory, and introductory electronics. We also have sections that let you get down and dirty with household items, from building your own robot to videos where we disassemble household items to see what's inside.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Physics/index.html>Physics</a></p><p>Learn about the basic principles that govern the physical world around us.  Solid understanding of algebra and a basic understanding of trigonometry necessary.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chemistry/index.html>Chemistry</a></p><p>Did you know that everything is made out of chemicals? Chemistry is the study of matter: its composition, properties, and reactivity. This material roughly covers a first-year high school or college course, and a good understanding of algebra is helpful. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=AP_Physics_2/index.html>AP_Physics_2</a></p><p>An algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that explores topics such as fluid statics and dynamics; thermodynamics with kinetic theory; PV diagrams and probability; electrostatics; electrical circuits with capacitors; magnetic fields; electromagnetism; physical and geometric optics; and a whole lot more.</p></div>
