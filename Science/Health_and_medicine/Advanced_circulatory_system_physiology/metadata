Your heart sits in the middle of your chest and pumps blood from about 4 weeks after conception until the day that you die.  It never stops, and over your lifetime it will pump ~175 million liters of blood.  To visualize that, imagine the amount of water that falls over Niagara falls in a few minutes.  Remarkable!  This little pump is the size of your clenched fist and in an adult can weigh about 300 grams.
