<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Current_events_in_health_and_medicine/index.html>Current_events_in_health_and_medicine</a></p><p>Learn more about some of the current issues in health and medicine. Dr. Rishi Desai is a pediatric infectious disease physician and former epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Executive_systems_of_the_brain/index.html>Executive_systems_of_the_brain</a></p><p>Aristotle asserted that what separates humankind from non-human animals is our ability to engage in high reasoning. This reasoning includes solving problems, making decisions, recalling and recording memories, and expressing complex emotions. We’ll explore different states of consciousness, and how our brain adapts and responds to stimuli. Learn all about the higher-order executive functions of the brain, which help you remember your friend’s name, learn a new language, and even fall asleep at night.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Gastrointestinal_system_diseases/index.html>Gastrointestinal_system_diseases</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Respiratory_system_diseases/index.html>Respiratory_system_diseases</a></p><p>Our lungs are composed of a bronchial tree (think of an upside down tree with millions of leaves), blood vessels bringing blood in and out, and a protein-rich fluid that forms a matrix holding everything together!  If any part of this well-balanced organ isn’t working properly, a person can be left feeling short of breath.  The lungs are also exposed to the outside environment, making them prone to infections.  To counter infections, the lungs are lined with cells that have tiny protein bristles which wave back and forth and can literally sweep away dangerous bacteria.  Learn more about diseases of the lungs and how modern medicine helps to keep them healthy!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_nervous_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_nervous_system_physiology</a></p><p>There are billions and billions of neurons in your brain (about 85 billion), and they’re all sending electrical signals throughout your body right now! They tell your eyes to move across this page, how to interpret the words that you read, how to maintain your posture, your heart rate, and your breathing...all of it in a fraction of a second.  In this section, we’ll explore the nature of this vast, complex system, from the cellular level to how it operates at a sensory level. A common misconception is that we only have 5 senses (see, smell, taste, hear, and feel), but we have many more that are nuanced but equally important. Learn more about how our bodies are designed to interact with the world.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_respiratory_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_respiratory_system_physiology</a></p><p>Place your hand on your ribs and inhale deeply. You’ll notice that your chest expands and your back straightens. As this occurs, air is rushing through your windpipe and branches off to either your left or right lung. After 20 to 30 more branch points, oxygen in the air ends up in the alveoli where it diffuses into the liquid that surrounds the alveoli, and slips into the blood.  This microscopic gas exchange occurs rapidly, oxygen is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is removed from the body, and then you exhale. Learn more about the intricate and fascinating respiratory system in these videos!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Infectious_diseases/index.html>Infectious_diseases</a></p><p>There's an intricate dance between humans and viruses, bacteria, molds, and even tiny worms! They want to survive and replicate just like humans do... and this is why they cause infections. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Lab_values_and_concentrations_/index.html>Lab_values_and_concentrations_</a></p><p>Ever wonder about your lab values and what they mean? Lab values measure amounts of electrolytes or cells in your blood and occasionally tell you about how hormones and enzymes are working! Dive deeper and get a good understanding of concentrations as well!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_circulatory_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_circulatory_system_physiology</a></p><p>Your heart sits in the middle of your chest and pumps blood from about 4 weeks after conception until the day that you die.  It never stops, and over your lifetime it will pump ~175 million liters of blood.  To visualize that, imagine the amount of water that falls over Niagara falls in a few minutes.  Remarkable!  This little pump is the size of your clenched fist and in an adult can weigh about 300 grams.  Watch these videos to learn more about how the heart works, blood flow in arteries and veins, blood pressure, and lymphatics.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_gastrointestinal_physiology/index.html>Advanced_gastrointestinal_physiology</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Miscellaneous/index.html>Miscellaneous</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Mental_health/index.html>Mental_health</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Circulatory_system_diseases/index.html>Circulatory_system_diseases</a></p><p>With the heart pumping 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it’s absolutely vital to make sure things are flowing smoothly (pun intended!). Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case, and different parts of the circulatory system can cause problems: your heart, your blood vessels, and even the fluid in your tissues and blood itself can be the issue.  To further complicate things, the underlying reasons for circulatory system problems vary from your genes (nature) to your lifestyle habits (nurture). An understanding of how different diseases can affect your circulatory system is important to combat this growing problem in the world.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Endocrine_system_diseases/index.html>Endocrine_system_diseases</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_muscular_skeletal_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_muscular_skeletal_system_physiology</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_endocrine_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_endocrine_system_physiology</a></p><p>When you’re nervous before an important speech, or asking someone out on a date, you might feel butterflies in your stomach. This is actually the result of your endocrine system releasing hormones! You can’t really point to any single organ as “the endocrine system”, because it’s actually a family of glands that secrete hormones into the body. Hormones seep into the blood (imagine putting a tea bag into hot water), and as the blood flows around the body, it carries with it these important hormone molecules that interact with specific target cells and organs.  This signaling system helps to keep the entire body well-balanced and on the same page.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Muscular_skeletal_diseases/index.html>Muscular_skeletal_diseases</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Nervous_system_diseases/index.html>Nervous_system_diseases</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Health_care_system/index.html>Health_care_system</a></p><p>The health care system in the United States is rapidly changing. To better understand these changes, we review the health care insurance, drug pricing, physician compensation, and much more! join us as we explore the basics about the Health Care system in the US, including a comparison with European healthcare.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Human_anatomy_and_physiology/index.html>Human_anatomy_and_physiology</a></p><p>Get introduced to all of the major organ systems of the body. You'll learn some general anatomy (roadmap for your body), and how the organs work to keep you alive! Watch some videos, read some articles, try some flashcards, and then quiz yourself!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Hematologic_system_diseases/index.html>Hematologic_system_diseases</a></p><p>Blood is incredibly important in combating disease and the healing process after an injury. It acts as a highway for medicine, stops bleeding, fights infections, controls cells from multiplying too fast, and so much more. But things can go wrong with blood too! What if your blood couldn’t clot and stop you from bleeding, or started to clot uncontrollably? What if your red blood cells or white blood cells suddenly disappeared? Blood contains many different types of tissues doing very different jobs, making diseases of the blood produce a variety of symptoms, including continuously feeling tired and bone pain. Learn about the different blood diseases, how they are diagnosed, and the cool ways health professionals treat these conditions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_hematologic_system_physiology/index.html>Advanced_hematologic_system_physiology</a></p><p>It takes between 30 seconds to a minute for your blood to travel from your heart, to your body, and back to the heart again - perhaps a bit longer if the trip is out to your big toe! Our blood is incredibly important for transporting oxygen throughout the body. Hemoglobin, the protein that fills our blood cells, has wonderful mechanisms to allow it to bind to both oxygen and carbon dioxide. This is important for effective and quick transport of the gases around our body. Our blood is about 45% cells and 55% plasma, so the old adage “blood is thicker than water” quite literally holds true in scientific terms! Learn more about how this amazing system works in the following videos.</p></div>
