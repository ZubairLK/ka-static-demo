Our genes are survivors. Even though a person might die, his or her genes will go on to the next generation and then the next generation…  Some genes are exactly the same as the ones in your great-great-great-grandmother! Yet, with the exception of identical twins, we are all genetically distinct from our family members. Starting with sexual reproduction and then the development of a baby, we’re going to take a journey that starts with our own microscopic beginning, and ends with a fully formed baby entering the world.
