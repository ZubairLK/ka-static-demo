Your heart is an electrical organ, and it produces a rather rhythmic music - lub-dub, lub-dub. We are able to measure its music through the electrocardiogram (EKG), which is able to pick up pathological rhythms - supraventricular tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachyardia for instance-  through electrical leads placed on the chest. We will discover how to identify these dysrthymias as well as how these conditions are treated, such as through the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs and pacemakers.
