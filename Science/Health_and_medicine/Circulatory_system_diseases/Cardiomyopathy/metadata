Cardiomyopathy encompasses a group of diseases in which the myocardium (heart muscle) is unable to contract, leading to cardiac dysfunction. These flavors come in three flavors - dilated, restrictive, and hypertrophic. Patients unfortunately are at risk for heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. We will discuss the signs and symptoms of the cardiomyopathies as well as what clinicians can do to treat these conditions.
