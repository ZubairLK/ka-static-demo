Shock is a rather common clinical situation, especially in the emergency room. Quite simply, circulatory shock refers to poor perfusion of organs with blood. For example, shock may result from loss of blood (hemorrhage), a poorly functioning heart (heart failure), or dilated blood vessels (sepsis and anaphylactic shock). We will explore how to differentiate the many different causes of shock here.
