We've talked a lot about distances to stars, but how do we know?  Stellar parallax--which looks at how much a star shifts  in the sky when Earth is at various points in its orbit--is the oldest technique we have for measuring how far stars are.

It is great for "nearby" stars even with precise instruments (i.e, in our part of our galaxy).  To measure distance further, we have to start thinking about Cepheid variables (other tutorial).
