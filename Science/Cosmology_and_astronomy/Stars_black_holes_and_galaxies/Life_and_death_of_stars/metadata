Stars begin when material drifting in space condenses due to gravity to be dense enough for fusion to occur.  Depending on the volume and make-up of this material, the star could then develop into very different things--from supernovae, to neutron stars, to black holes. 

This tutorial explores the life of stars and will have you appreciating the grand weirdness of our reality.
