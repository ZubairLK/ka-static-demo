Quasars are the brightest objects in the universe.  The gamma rays from them could sterilize a solar system (i.e. obliterate life).  What do we think these objects are?  Why don't we see any close by (which we should be thankful for)?  Could they tell us what our own galaxy may have been like 1 billion or so years ago?
