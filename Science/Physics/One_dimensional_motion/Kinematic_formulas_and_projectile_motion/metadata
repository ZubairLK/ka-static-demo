We don't believe in memorizing formulas and neither should you (unless you want to live your life as a shadow of your true potential).  This tutorial builds on what we know about displacement, velocity and acceleration to solve problems in kinematics (including projectile motion problems).  Along the way, we derive (and re-derive) some of the classic formulas that you might see in your physics book.
