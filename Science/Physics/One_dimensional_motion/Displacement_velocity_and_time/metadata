This tutorial is the backbone of your understanding of kinematics (i.e., the motion of objects).  You might already know that distance = rate x time.  This tutorial essentially reviews that idea with a vector lens (we introduce you to vectors here as well).  So strap your belts (actually this might not be necessary since we don't plan on decelerating in this tutorial) and prepare for a gentle ride of foundational physics knowledge.
