In these videos and articles you'll learn how flat and curved/parabolic mirrors create images. The definitions of real and virtual images will be discussed. You'll also learn how to use the mirror equation to determine the image distance, magnification, image height, and object height when dealing with curved mirrors. The sign convention for positive and negative image distance, object distance, and focal length will be discussed.
