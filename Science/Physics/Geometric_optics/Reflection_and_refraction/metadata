In these videos and articles you'll learn how to determine the angle of reflected light and the definition of specular and diffuse reflection. You'll also learn how to use Snell's law to determine the angle of a refracted light ray. Example problems dealing with the refraction of light rays will be solved. The topics of total internal reflection, critical angle, and dispersion will also be discussed.
