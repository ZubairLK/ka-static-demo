We've all slid down slides/snow-or-mud-covered-hills/railings at some point in our life (if not, you haven't really lived) and noticed that the smoother the surface the more we would accelerate (try to slide down a non-snow-or-mud-covered hill).  This tutorial looks into this in some depth.  We'll look at masses on inclined planes and think about static and kinetic friction.
