A dog is balancing on one arm on my head.  Is my head applying a force to the dog's hand?  If it weren't, wouldn't there be nothing to offset the pull of gravity causing the acrobatic dog to fall?  What would we call this force?  Can we have a general term from the component of a contact force that acts perpendicular to the plane of contact?  These are absolutely normal questions to ask.
