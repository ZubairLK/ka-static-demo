Hi everyone, I'm David, and I love physics. Have a physics question/comment? Ask me anything. I'll be checking the comments section every couple hours until Sunday August 2nd at 12:00 PM PST and replying as often as possible. 

Also, please feel free to answer other people's questions if you know the answer.
