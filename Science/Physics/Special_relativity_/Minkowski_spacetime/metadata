In a Newtonian world we assume that the passage of time or lengths in space are absolute--that regardless of one's inertial frame of reference, everyone would agree that the same time passed in every frame of reference and that something of a certain length in one frame would be the same length in other frames.  This leads to the speed of light needing to be relative depending on the frame of reference which contradicts observation.  We reconcile observations by loosening our assumptions about absolute space and time.  We explore this through Minkowski spacetime diagrams.
