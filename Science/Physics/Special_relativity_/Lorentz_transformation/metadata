We'll now put some algebraic meat on our special relativity bone by introducing ourselves to the Lorentz transformation.  Interestingly, Lorentz came up with them before Einstein introduced Special Relativity as a nice way to reconcile some observations, but special relativity game them real conceptual meat.  The Lorentz transformation is going to allow us to calculate the spacetime coordinates in different frames of reference!
