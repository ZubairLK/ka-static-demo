In these videos and articles you'll learn the definition of specific heat and latent heat and how to use them in problem solving. You'll also learn the 3 modes of heat transfer; conduction, convection, and radiation. Lastly, we will look in more depth at how the rate of thermal conduction through a material depends on the material's thickness, conductivity constant, area, and difference in temperature.
