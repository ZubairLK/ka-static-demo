In these videos and articles you'll learn how the first law of thermodynamics relates the change in internal energy of a gas, heat that enters the gas, and work done on the gas. PV diagrams will be discussed, as well as the four common thermal process; isobaric, isochoric/isovolumetric, isothermal, and isovolumetric processes.

You'll also learn about how the second law of thermodynamics relates the entropy change to the multiplicity of microstates and the heat that enters a macroscopic system. The efficiency of a heat engine will also be explained.
