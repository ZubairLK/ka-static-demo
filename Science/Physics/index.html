<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Circuits/index.html>Circuits</a></p><p>Circuits make computers, digital cameras, and video games possible. Circuits are driving an unprecedented rate of change in how we live. In this topic you'll learn about the physics behind the electronic devices we use.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Electromagnetic_waves_and_interference/index.html>Electromagnetic_waves_and_interference</a></p><p>Light can seem mysterious. What is light made out of? What causes color? How do 3D movies work? Learn about some of the mysterious properties of light in these tutorials.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Thermodynamics/index.html>Thermodynamics</a></p><p>Heat can be useful, but it can also be annoying. Understanding heat and the flow of heat allows us to build heat sinks that prevent our computers from overheating, build better engines, and prevent freeway overpasses from cracking.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Geometric_optics/index.html>Geometric_optics</a></p><p>Light waves can be bent and reflected to form new and sometimes altered images. Understanding how light rays can be manipulated allows us to create better contact lenses, fiber optic cables, and high powered telescopes.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Oscillations_and_mechanical_waves/index.html>Oscillations_and_mechanical_waves</a></p><p>Waves are responsible for basically every form of communication we use. Whether you're talking out loud, texting on your phone, or waving to someone in a crowd there's going to be a wave transmitting information. Learn about the basics of waves in this topic, then learn more about light waves in the topics below.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=One_dimensional_motion/index.html>One_dimensional_motion</a></p><p>In this tutorial we begin to explore ideas of velocity and acceleration.  We do exciting things like throw things off cliffs (far safer on paper than in real life) and see how high a ball will fly in the air.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Torque_and_angular_momentum/index.html>Torque_and_angular_momentum</a></p><p>Everything you've learned about motion, forces, energy, and momentum can be reused to analyze rotating objects. There are some differences, though. Here, you'll learn about rotational motion, moments, torque, and angular momentum.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Discoveries_and_projects/index.html>Discoveries_and_projects</a></p><p>Rediscover the most important Scientific observations in a historical progression</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Magnetic_forces_magnetic_fields_and_Faraday_s_law/index.html>Magnetic_forces_magnetic_fields_and_Faraday_s_law</a></p><p>Magnetic fields are extremely useful. The magnetic field of the Earth shields us from harmful radiation from the Sun, magnetic fields allow us to diagnose medical problems using an MRI, and magnetic fields are a key component in generating electrical power in most power plants. In this topic you'll learn about the forces, fields, and laws that makes these and so many other applications possible. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Ask_a_Physicist_archived_/index.html>Ask_a_Physicist_archived_</a></p><p>Hi everyone, I'm David, and I love physics. Have a physics question/comment? Ask me anything. I'll be checking the comments section every couple hours until Sunday August 2nd at 12:00 PM PST and replying as often as possible. 

Also, please feel free to answer other people's questions if you know the answer.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Special_relativity_/index.html>Special_relativity_</a></p><p>Think you know about time and space? Think again. Einstein basically did a pile driver on all our brains when he came up with his theory of special relativity. 
</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Quantum_Physics/index.html>Quantum_Physics</a></p><p>Do you want to describe the microscopic world of atoms and nuclei? Well, classical physics isn't going to cut it. You'll need quantum physics to explain things like atomic energy levels, photons, and the wavelength of electrons.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Review_for_AP_Physics_1_exam/index.html>Review_for_AP_Physics_1_exam</a></p><p>Studying for the AP Physics 1 exam? Watch these materials to help you review.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Impacts_and_linear_momentum/index.html>Impacts_and_linear_momentum</a></p><p>Momentum ties velocity and mass into one quantity. It might not be obvious why this is useful, but momentum has this cool property where the total amount of it never changes. This is called the conservation of momentum, and we can use it to analyze collisions and other interactions. Bam!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Work_and_energy/index.html>Work_and_energy</a></p><p>"Energy" is a word that's used a lot. Here, you'll learn about how it's one of the most useful concepts in physics. Along the way, we'll talk about work, kinetic energy, potential energy, conservation of energy, and mechanical advantage.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Forces_and_Newton_s_laws_of_motion/index.html>Forces_and_Newton_s_laws_of_motion</a></p><p>This is the meat of much of classical physics.  We think about what a force is and how Newton changed the world's (and possibly your) view of how reality works.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Two_dimensional_motion/index.html>Two_dimensional_motion</a></p><p>You understand velocity and acceleration well in one-dimension.  Now we can explore scenarios that are even more fun.  With a little bit of trigonometry (you might want to review your basic trig, especially what sin and cos are), we can think about whether a baseball can clear the "green monster" at Fenway Park.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Fluids/index.html>Fluids</a></p><p>Atmospheric pressure is like an invisible friend who is always squeezing you with a big hug. Learn more about pressure, buoyant force, and flowing fluid so you can appreciate the sometimes invisible, but crucial, effect they have on us and the world around us.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Centripetal_force_and_gravitation/index.html>Centripetal_force_and_gravitation</a></p><p>Learn about centripetal acceleration and centripetal force. Also, learn about the universal law of gravitation and gravitational orbits.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Community_explanations/index.html>Community_explanations</a></p><p>Calling great explainers of the world!

Help us answer frequently asked physics questions by writing clear, deep, engaging explanations. Your explanation may even be selected for an article on Khan Academy (with full credit to you)!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Electric_charge_field_and_potential/index.html>Electric_charge_field_and_potential</a></p><p>Electric forces hold together the atoms and molecules in your eyes which allow you to read this sentence. Take a moment and learn about the force that holds our bodies together.</p></div>
