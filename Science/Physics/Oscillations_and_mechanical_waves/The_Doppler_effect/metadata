In these videos and articles you'll learn how the Doppler effect causes a change in the measured frequency of a moving source of sound or moving sound detector. You'll also learn how to calculate the observed frequency using the formula for the Doppler effect when dealing with either a moving source of sound or a moving sound detector.
