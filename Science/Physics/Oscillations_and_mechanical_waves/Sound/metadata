In these videos and articles you'll see visualizations of the propagation of sound waves, along with a visual definition of a sound wave's amplitude, period, frequency, and wavelength. You'll also learn how the speed of sound depends on the different characteristics of the medium. It will be shown how Mach numbers characterize faster than sound travel and their relationship to sonic booms. Also, you'll learn about the decibel scale, why sounds get softer, and how ultrasound medical imaging works.
