In these videos and articles you'll learn how magnetic flux depends on magnetic field strength, area, and angle. You'll also learn how Faraday's law states that a changing magnetic flux can cause an induced current. It will be shown how Lenz's law can allow you to find the direction of the induced current. Example problems will also be solved to show how to apply Faraday's law and Lenz's law.
