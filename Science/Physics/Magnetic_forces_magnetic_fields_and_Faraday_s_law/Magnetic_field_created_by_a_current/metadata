In these videos and articles you'll learn how the magnetic field created by a long straight wire depends on the current and distance from the wire. You'll also learn how to use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic force between two current carrying wires will be discussed as well as the induced current in a wire moving through a magnetic field.
