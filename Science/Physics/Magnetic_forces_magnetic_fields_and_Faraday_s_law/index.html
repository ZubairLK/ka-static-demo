<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Electric_motors/index.html>Electric_motors</a></p><p>In these videos and articles you'll learn how electric motors rely on a magnetic force that can cause a torque which rotates a loop of wire. You'll also learn how commutators allow the direction the the current to switch, which causes the motor to continue turning. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Magnetic_flux_and_Faraday_s_law/index.html>Magnetic_flux_and_Faraday_s_law</a></p><p>In these videos and articles you'll learn how magnetic flux depends on magnetic field strength, area, and angle. You'll also learn how Faraday's law states that a changing magnetic flux can cause an induced current. It will be shown how Lenz's law can allow you to find the direction of the induced current. Example problems will also be solved to show how to apply Faraday's law and Lenz's law.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Magnetic_field_created_by_a_current/index.html>Magnetic_field_created_by_a_current</a></p><p>In these videos and articles you'll learn how the magnetic field created by a long straight wire depends on the current and distance from the wire. You'll also learn how to use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic force between two current carrying wires will be discussed as well as the induced current in a wire moving through a magnetic field.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Magnets_and_Magnetic_Force/index.html>Magnets_and_Magnetic_Force</a></p><p>In these videos and articles you'll learn how the magnitude of the magnetic force depends on the charge, velocity, and magnetic field. You'll also learn how to use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force. Lastly, it will be explained how to determine the magnetic force on a current carrying wire.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Skill_check_for_Magnetic_fields_forces_and_Faraday_s_law/index.html>Skill_check_for_Magnetic_fields_forces_and_Faraday_s_law</a></p><p>This skill check will help you determine which area you need to study more.</p></div>
