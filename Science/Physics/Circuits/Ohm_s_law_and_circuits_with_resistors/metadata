In these videos and articles you'll learn how Ohm's law relates the voltage across a resistor, the current through a resistor, and the resistance of the resistor. You'll also learn how resistors in series and parallel combine to form an equivalent resistance. The resistivity of materials, power used by a resistor, and how to use voltmeters and ammeters will also be discussed.
