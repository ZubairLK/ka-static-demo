In these videos and articles you'll learn how capacitors store charge and energy. You'll also learn the relationships between capacitance, charge stored, energy stored, and voltage across a capacitor. Techniques for finding the equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series and parallel will be discussed. Lastly, you'll learn how a dielectric can change the amount of charge, voltage, and capacitance of a capacitor.
