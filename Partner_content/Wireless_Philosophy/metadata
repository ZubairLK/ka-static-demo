Wi-Phi's mission is to introduce people to the practice of philosophy by offering lectures on philosophical issues and critical thinking concepts that are freely available in a form that is entertaining, interesting and accessible to people with no background in the subject.

We see this as a part of a larger mission: building our collective capacity to engage in rational thought and discourse. Â By providing the toolkit for building better minds, we hope that Wi-Phi plays some small role in realizing that goal.
