Humans have evolved just like all other species. We modern humans are the only remaining descendants of a once varied family of primates called hominids. All other hominids are now extinct. Fossils and DNA continue to reveal the details of our complex evolutionary history, which extends back millions of years and reveals that humans and other living primates share a common ancestor. New fossil finds continue to clarify what other hominids looked like, and how and when they lived.Technology to study DNA has emerged in the past few decades, adding to what fossils tell us.
