Evolutionary knowledge about life on Earth affects our well-being every day, in ways perhaps less apparent but no less important than any of the other sciences. Phylogenetic sequence analysis, or understanding the relatedness of one species to others, can help scientists: identify viruses and develop effective vaccines, identify new species and thus inform biodiversity conservation efforts, or aid in the cultivation of pathogen-resistant crops. And identifying the evolutionary processes of disease agents that transfer between species may help scientists determine how to prevent and treat emerging diseases.
