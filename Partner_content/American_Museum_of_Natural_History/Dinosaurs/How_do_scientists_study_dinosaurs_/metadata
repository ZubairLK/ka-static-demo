To learn about ancient life, scientists study fossils. Finding these traces of ancient life takes time and experience. Paleontologists search carefully for bits of exposed bone, then typically transport the large piece of rock that contains the fossil back to the lab. Trackways provide some of the best clues about dinosaur behavior. Studying living birds and other reptiles, which are related to dinosaurs, gives insight into behavior and biology. Paleontologists also turn 
to experts in other ﬁelds. For example, geochemists analyze fossil bones and teeth for clues about paleoclimate, while paleobotanists examine coprolites for the physical and chemical traces of ancient plants. Together, these scientists are ﬁlling in the picture of what these giant dinosaurs ate, how fast they grew, and how long they lived.
