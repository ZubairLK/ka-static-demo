The Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded in 1870, is one of the world’s largest and finest museums. Its collections span more than 5,000 years of world culture, from prehistory to the present and from every part of the globe. The Museum’s 2.4 million-square-foot building has vast holdings represented by a series of collections, each of which ranks in its category among the best in the world. Last year, the Museum had about 30 million unique visits to its website (metmuseum.org) and more than six million visitors to its two New York locations—its main building along Fifth Avenue and The Cloisters, its branch for medieval art and architecture in northern Manhattan.
