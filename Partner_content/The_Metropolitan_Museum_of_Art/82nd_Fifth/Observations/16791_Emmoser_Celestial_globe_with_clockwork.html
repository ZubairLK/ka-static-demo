<p>Video Title : Emmoser, Celestial globe with clockwork
</p><p>Video Description : Met curator Clare Vincent on art and science in Gerhard Emmoser’s Celestial globe with clockwork, 1579.

This globe houses a movement made by Gerhard Emmoser, imperial clockmaker from 1566 until his death in 1584, who signed and dated the meridian ring. The movement, which has been extensively rebuilt, rotated in the celestial sphere and drove a small image of the sun along the path of the ecliptic. The hour was indicated on a dial mounted at the top of the globe's axis and the day of the year appeared on a calendar rotating in the instrument's horizon ring. The silver globe, with its exquisitely engraved constellations and Pegasus support, is the work of an anonymous goldsmith who was probably employed in the imperial workshops in Vienna or Prague.
