The â€œ Rhenish" Symphony was inspired by a boat trip that Robert and Clara Schumann made in 1850 on the Rhein River, as well as their visit to the great gothic cathedral of Cologne. It is a celebration of traditional life and folklore along the legendary river, and is filled with the spirit of German Romanticism. Music Director Gerard Schwarz offers a guide to this exciting musical journey.
