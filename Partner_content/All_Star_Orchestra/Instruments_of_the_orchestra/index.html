Principals from the All-Star Orchestra introduce the special qualities and histories of each instrument.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Percussion_/index.html>Percussion_</a></p><p>This large family, including timpani, drums, cymbals, xylophones, gongs, bells, and rattles, is comprised of  musical instruments played by striking with the hand or with a stick or beater, or by shaking or rubbing.  The All-Star Orchestra percussion section demonstrates the remarkable variety of sounds that can be produced. Also included in this group are orchestral keyboard instruments like the piano and celesta.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Woodwinds/index.html>Woodwinds</a></p><p>This family of instruments is situated in the middle of the orchestra, and is comprised of three groups: the flutes (flutes, piccolo), single reeds (clarinets, bass-clarinet), and double reeds (oboe, English horn, bassoons, contra-bassoon) Watch and listen as principal players of the All-Star Orchestra demonstrate their instruments and tell about their musical lives. </p></div>
