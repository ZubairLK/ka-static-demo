The largest group within the orchestra is comprised of instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings. The vibrations – resulting from the strings being played by a bow, or being plucked with the fingers – resonate within the body of each instrument. The violin, viola, cello and contrabass are all primary played with a bow. The harp is  plucked and stroked with the hands. Principals from the All-Star Orchestra introduce the special qualities and histories of each instrument.
