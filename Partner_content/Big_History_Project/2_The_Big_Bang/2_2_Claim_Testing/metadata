The focus of this lesson is to begin to understand the process of claim testing. We use the term "claim testing" in Big History to mean the process that someone goes through when evaluating the truth of a statement that is made either in Big History or in other research that you might do. In general, when you encounter a claim, itâ€™s important to ask why you should believe and trust in that claim. This is a core idea in Big History, and you should use claim testing on a regular basis throughout the course.
