How *did* life transform from a single-celled organism to our own species, one that can create, communicate, love, and hate? We’ll explore how bacteria, plants, and animals have transformed over time, leading to the arrival of Homo sapiens (fancy words for humans). We’ll then take a look at how this process of change led to the cultural evolution of humans and the development of our most powerful skill, collective learning.
