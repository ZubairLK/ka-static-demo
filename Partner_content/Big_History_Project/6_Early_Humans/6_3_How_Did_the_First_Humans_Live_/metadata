We often teach dogs a few basic tricks, such as how to sit, stay, and fetch. However, have you ever seen dogs teach one another tricks? They might mimic each other’s behavior, but that’s really not the same thing. Humans, on the other hand, can deliberately pass information to each other and teach one another new skills. This makes it much easier for each generation to pick up where the previous one left off, and it’s why we are the only species able to dominate the biosphere. But why have humans evolved into such a powerful species? What makes us special? Here the story continues, as our ancestors evolve from early Homo sapiens to more intelligent beings who are able to learn collectively. Collective learning is the foundation on which modern society is built, and the reason our species continues to build upon what previous generations created.
