Big History tells the story of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present. It would be impossible for any history course to cover everything related to its subject matter, and this challenge is particularly great in Big History because of the scales of time and size involved. Big History deals with this challenge by focusing on the eight turning points, or thresholds, over the course of the 13.8 billion-year story. At each of these thresholds, the Universe became more complex, and things appeared with significant new emergent properties. In this lesson, you’ll review what you’ve learned about this story, which will put you in the perfect position to think about the future of Big History in subsequent lessons in this unit.
