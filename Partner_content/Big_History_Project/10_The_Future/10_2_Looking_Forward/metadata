Historians typically focus on the past, asking questions like: What happened in the past? Why did it happen? What lessons can be drawn from these events? Studying the past is possible because there is lots of interesting evidence left behind for scholars of many disciplines—not just historians—to look at. Physicists, for example, can look at the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Universe today and draw conclusions about the early history of the Universe. Geologists can look at the distribution of plants and animals and rock formations on the Earth today and draw conclusions about the how the configuration of the Earth’s continents has changed over time. Each discipline has its own questions and evidence and is interested in investigating change over time. Historians don’t typically predict the future, but given the number of trends you’ve studied in this course, it seems appropriate to give some thought to what the future might be like.
