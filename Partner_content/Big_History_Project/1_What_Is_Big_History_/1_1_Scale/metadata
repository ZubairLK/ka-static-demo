Scale is incredibly important in understanding Big History. As you already know, this course looks at history at a larger scale than any other history course we’ve seen, and studying time and space over 13.8 billion years poses an interesting challenge. One way of dealing with this challenge is by using different scales so that each topic can be studied from the appropriate perspective. In this lesson, you’ll watch a video on scale, and then take part in an activity that will get you out of your chair. By the time you’ve seen the video and finished the activity, you’ll have a good sense of how scale can affect the way we view things.
