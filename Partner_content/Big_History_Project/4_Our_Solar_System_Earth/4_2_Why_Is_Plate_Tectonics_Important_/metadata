In the last lesson, you learned that the interior of the Earth changed over time to give the planet the unique layering that it currently possesses. In this lesson, you will learn that the surface of the Earth changes as well. The high temperatures that caused the differentiation of the Earth’s layers continue even today. In a process known as plate tectonics, the heat and movement of the mantle floating under the Earth’s crust drive the movement of the Earth’s crust over its surface. The slow shifting of these tectonic plates explains the shape of our continents as well as mountain ranges and traumatic events like earthquakes.
