Are shadows always black, or can they take on the colors of the rainbow? 

In this hands-on science snack, which was developed and demonstrated by Exploratorium Senior Scientist Paul Doherty, youâ€™ll have fun with colored lightbulbs, experiment with additive color mixtures, and learn about human color perception.

Watch the videos, build your own colored shadows, and see how exciting light and shadow can be.
