Turn an old CD into a spectroscope to analyze light—you may be surprised by what you see. Try pointing your CD spectroscope at the fluorescent light in your room, sunlit clouds in the sky (but never the sun), even your friend’s colored shirt to reveal the wavelengths of light that mix together to create the color you see. It's your very own truth teller for light!
