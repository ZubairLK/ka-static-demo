The Exploratorium is a 21st-century learning laboratory and museum based in San Francisco. Since 1969, we’ve offered visitors and learners around the world the opportunity to experience everyday scientific phenomena firsthand through creative, thought-provoking exhibits, educational tools, and programs. We promote an inquiry-based approach to learning—one that ignites curiosity about the world around us, encourages exploration, and leads to profound discoveries.

The science "snacks" on this website are fun, hands-on activities developed and thoroughly tested by the Exploratorium Teacher Institute. Dive in and discover what we're all about!
