Can you light up a room with just five cents? 

A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. This activity, developed and demonstrated by Julie Yu, director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute, shows you how to build a battery strong enough to power an LED for a whole dayâ€”using nothing more than a few pennies and a salty solution. 

Watch the videos to learn how to build a battery of your very own, and light the way for other chemistry lovers.
