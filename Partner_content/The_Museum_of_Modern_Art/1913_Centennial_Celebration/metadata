1913 is a particularly important year within the history of modern art, marked by events and objects that would fundamentally change the way art was conceived and understood. In February of that year, the groundbreaking "Armory Show" introduced the American public to the work of Paul CÃ©zanne, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and many other European artists exhibited alongside their American avant-garde counterparts. In this series of videos, curators from all areas of the Museum speak about their favorite works from 1913 in MoMA's collection.
