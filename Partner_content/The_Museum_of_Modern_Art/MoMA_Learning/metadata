The history of modern art is not simply a linear progression of styles. Rather, artists respond to and participate in the intellectual, social, and cultural contexts of their time.  MoMA has a long history of experimental approaches to engaging people with art, which is at the core of the museum's mission. Listen to MoMA educators discuss how they teach challenging works of art, hear tips for teaching, and learn about MoMA's programs for individuals with dementia.
