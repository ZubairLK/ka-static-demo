To the north and east of Australia lie the islands known as Melanesia. These islands form one of the most culturally complex regions of the entire world, with 1,293 languages spoken across the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and the island of New Guinea. The British Museum collections date back to some of the earliest voyages in this area in the 19th century and it continues to collect, adding objects which reflect the contemporary development of the region.
