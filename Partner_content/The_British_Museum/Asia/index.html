In many ways, then as now, it was a hub and meeting place for diverse cultures and neighbours, both near and distant, over thousands of years.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Myanmar/index.html>Myanmar</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=China/index.html>China</a></p><p>Ancient China includes the Neolithic period, defined as the age before the use of metal, when China witnessed a transition from a nomadic existence to one of settled farming. Imperial Chinese history is marked by the rise and fall of many dynasties and occasional periods of disunity, but overall the age was remarkably stable and marked by a sophisticated governing system that included the concept of a meritocracy. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Indonesia/index.html>Indonesia</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Iran/index.html>Iran</a></p><p>The following articles and videos explore seventeenth-century Iran through the reign and legacy of one of its most influential rulers, Shah 'Abbas I (reigned 1587–1629).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Thailand/index.html>Thailand</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=India/index.html>India</a></p><p>South Asia is the seat of many of the world’s great religious traditions, most notably Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Japan/index.html>Japan</a></p><p>The British Museum has one of the most comprehensive collections of Japanese material culture in Europe.
