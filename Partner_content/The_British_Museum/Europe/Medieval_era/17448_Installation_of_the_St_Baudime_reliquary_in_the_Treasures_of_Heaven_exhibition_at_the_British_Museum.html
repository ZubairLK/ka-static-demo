<p>Video Title : Installation of the St Baudime reliquary in the Treasures of Heaven exhibition at the British Museum
</p><p>Video Description : This reliquary was made between 1146 and 1178 and may once have held a relic 
of St Baudime’s blood. The relic would have been held in a cavity at the back of the reliquary but it is no longer contained inside. There is no record of relics being contained inside the reliquary beyond 1871.

St Baudime’s reliquary has a turbulent history – the gemstones which were once studded all over his vestments were likely removed during the French Revolution in the 1790s. The reliquary was also stolen at the beginning of the 20th century by a notorious art thief. It was found soon after by police, apparently languishing in a wine cellar.

We might normally expect this type of reliquary (known as a ‘speaking reliquary’) to contain a skull – as the form of the reliquary would literally speak its contents. However, there is no record of this container ever having held a skull relic, which further adds to the object’s mystery. © Trustees of the British Museum
