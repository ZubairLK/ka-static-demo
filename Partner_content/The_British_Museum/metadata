The British Museum was founded in 1753, the first national public museum in the world. When the doors opened to the public in 1759, each day about 75 people made their way round. In 2013, annual visits rose to 6.7 million. Through Khan Academy, you can explore world cultures through articles and videos about the British Museumâ€™s collection and special exhibitions.
