Tate holds the United Kingdom's national collection of British art from 1500 to the present day alongside international modern and contemporary art. Through imaginative education and interpretation programmes we aim to promote public understanding and enjoyment of art. Here you can explore the subject and learn from artists, curators, critics and writers.
