So what exactly is an archive? In this series of videos, you will come across everything from jukeboxes to sketchbooks, from careful documentation to experiments in chance. Take a look at how an archive can become a creative laboratory, not only tracing and documenting an artist’s work, but also inspiring others in the process. How can sketchbooks bring an artist’s art and practice to life? How can we preserve something as time-based and ephemeral as performance art? How can old archives inspire us to make art in new ways?
