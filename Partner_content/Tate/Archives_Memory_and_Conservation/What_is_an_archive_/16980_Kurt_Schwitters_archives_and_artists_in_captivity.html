<p>Video Title : Kurt Schwitters' archives and artists in captivity
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

From 1940 to 1941,  during the second world war, thousands of German and Austrian nationals were interned in Great Britain. Among the many in the Hutchinson internment camp was German painter and sculptor Kurt Schwitters, who continued to work despite facing difficult conditions and a lack of materials. Bolstered by the strong artistic and intellectual community that developed within the camp, Schwitters continued to paint, sculpt, and craft using materials as diverse as old wood from a piano, vinyl, and even porridge! Artistic exhibitions and even a theatre were developed in the camp, and the imprisoned artistic community flourished. By chance, art historian Klaus Hinrichsen was interned with Schwitters, and as such he produced a careful series of documents that captured their time–and Schwitters’ work–in the internment camp.
By a very lucky twist of fate, Schwitters was interned with not only a community of fellow artists but also a master archivist in the form of Hinrichsen, who made sure to preserve Schwitters’ work and process. This fortuitous archive remains as a testament to what artists can produce even if in confinement. Can you think of any other artists that produced great work in the face of difficulty?
