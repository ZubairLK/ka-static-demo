<p>Video Title : A Juke Box at Tate Britain: Listening to and making audio archives
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

In 2013, artist Yuri Suzuki created an immersive sound installation using music, audio archives, and even visitor recordings to act as a “soundtrack” to the Tate Britain collection. Using juke boxes in the gallery, Suzuki created an eclectic archive of sound that visitors could browse and listen to in conjunction with what they were seeing. The juke boxes were filled with sound material including clips of artists speaking about their work, lectures by curators, personal letters from artists like Paul Nash, and music inspired by the art in the gallery. Visitors could play records as they pleased, creating an atmosphere for the entire room, but they could also create their own sonic responses and have their voices recorded into a vinyl record to be saved and added to the juke box collection.
The content of an archive might seem like the most important thing about it, but what about the format and system in which it is stored–and shared? Why do you think Suzuki chose the juke box as the medium for this in-gallery archive?
