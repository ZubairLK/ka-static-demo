<p>Video Title : Josef Herman's personal sketches of Wales
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

At the climax of World War II, Polish-Jewish artist Josef Herman finally left his war-torn home to seek refuge abroad. In 1944, he settled in the South Wales mining town of Ystradgynlais which would be his home for years to come and became deeply involved with the local community. Every morning he would sketch the miners and their families, creating pictures that capture the grandeur and sadness of the working man, the dignity of manual labour, and the relentless difficulty faced by the miners each and every day. Take a look at how Herman’s sketches and archival drawings bring his time in Ystradgynlais to life.
Being an exile and a refugee, do you think documentation and archiving played a special role in Josef Herman’s practice as an artist? Would being so far from home influence his relationship with documenting the things around him?

Explore the sketches in Josef Herman's archive collection here.
