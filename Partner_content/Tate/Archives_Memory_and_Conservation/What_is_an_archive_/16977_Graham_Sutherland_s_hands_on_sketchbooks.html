<p>Video Title : Graham Sutherland's hands-on sketchbooks
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

By the 1930s, painter Graham Sutherland had become a major figure in British art and continued to be influential until his death in the 1970s. His landscapes, organic forms, and surrealist figures were often conceived in the pages of his sketchbooks, which can be seen today in the Tate archives. Because of their age and fragility, these sketchbooks are being completely digitised as to preserve them and allow the public to view and interact with them. Sutherland’s sketchbooks are essential to understanding the artist’s practice: they are rough, paint-spattered, and covered in marks, giving us a glimpse into Sutherland’s hands-on approach to planning and creating a painting.
Seeing an actual work of art is one thing, but what benefits could there be to preserving art digitally? Does it allow for us to interact with art in ways we might never be able to handle the original? Is it a useful tool for people who can’t physically come to a museum or gallery?
