<p>Video Title : Conserving Chris Ofili
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Tate’s Conservation Department works hard behind the scenes to ensure that future generations can enjoy the paintings, sculptures, and other works in the collection. But it’s not just the old masters that get their attention–because contemporary artists work in a diverse and sometimes unusual range of materials, the team often undertakes extensive research to help them and see how their works will hold up in the future. Join paintings conservator Natasha Walker as she explains how the team goes about conserving Chris Ofili’s paintings by creating replicas of his works and subjecting them to drops, falls, cracks, and accelerated aging processes. With the help of the artist, his assistants, and even an elephant, the team’s “Chris Ofilis” might not be as good as the real thing, but they will help protect the originals well into the future.
