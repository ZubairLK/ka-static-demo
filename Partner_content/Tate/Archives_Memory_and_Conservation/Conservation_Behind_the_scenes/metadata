Even the greatest works of art require care as they ageâ€”how do we preserve works of art, and how do we fix them if they have been damaged? In this tutorial, take a look behind the scenes at the work of the conservation team as they preserve works of art in unstable environments, restore great paintings that have been vandalised, and even create their own works of art in order to subject them to extensive experimentation. Learn about the art and science of conservation here.
