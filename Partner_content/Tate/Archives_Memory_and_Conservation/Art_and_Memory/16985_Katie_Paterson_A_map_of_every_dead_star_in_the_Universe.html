<p>Video Title : Katie Paterson: A map of every dead star in the Universe
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Artist Katie Paterson has created a map detailing the location of the 27,000 dead stars that have ever been observed and recorded in human history–and her map continues to grow with each dying star. In order to create her map, Paterson consulted with physicists, librarians, and archivists to compile a record of the stars that have been recorded and that have since faded away or exploded. In her project the boundary is fuzzy between life and death, between the end of one star and the beginning of another, and it invites us to how we remember and record the past.
But with stars dying every day, could a project like this ever be completed? If Paterson were to make a map of every dead star then it would be the size of the Earth itself. There’s also the impossibility of the task as it is ultimately infinite—why would an artist begin an artwork that is impossible to finish and with no foreseeable end?
