<p>Video Title : Michael Landy and Jean Tinguely: Art that breaks down 
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Join artist Michael Landy as he rummages through a heap of trash and reminisces about the culmination to his 2001 performance Break Down. Over three years, Landy catalogued each and every one of his worldly possessions and then systematically destroyed them in front of an audience. He draws in inspiration from the work of Swiss painter and sculpture Jean Tinguely, whose 1960 Homage to New York was a great sculptural machine designed to destroy itself and leave nothing behind as a record. Although Tinguely’s piece failed to self-destruct and was prematurely shut down by the fire brigade, it left behind an idea that Landy took up in his own work, decades later.
What’s the point of a self-destructing work of art? Is the work in the object itself, or in the performance around it? And in a world in which everything can be documented in images and videos, can a work of art every really erase itself from memory?
