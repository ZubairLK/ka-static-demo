<p>Video Title : Johno Verity, avalanche survivor, on "An Avalanche in the Alps"
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

In 2008, professional snowboarder Johno Verity was being filmed when he was taken by surprise and nearly buried by an avalanche. To see if an artist’s depiction could measure up to his own experience, Verity took close look at Philip James de Loutherbourg’s 1803 painting An Avalanche in the Alps. Looking at the painting gave Verity the chance to reflect upon the memory of his own avalanche survival experience–and to point out any inconsistencies in the artist’s depiction.
While the billowing clouds of snow and debris evoke the feelings of being in an avalanche, Verity rightfully points out that this painting is just an artist’s impression of such an experience. On the other hand, it is important to remember that every time we look at art we are undertaking an act of interpretation—we all bring personal experience to an artwork, and this influences the way we see and think about it. Do you think an artist capture the feeling of being somewhere without actually having been there him or herself? Does this make their work somehow less effective? And what about artists that depict things that aren’t even real?
