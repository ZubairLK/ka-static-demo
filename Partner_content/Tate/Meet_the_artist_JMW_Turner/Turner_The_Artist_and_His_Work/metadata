J.M.W. Turner was both an artist of his time and a radical “modernist,” a practitioner of traditional styles of painting and a precursor of those to come many decades later. He was a robust personality and a sensitive observer of the events that shaped the world in his lifetime. As you learn about Turner and look closely at his work, think about the relationship between biography and practice. Should art be separated from events in the artist’s life or seen objectively? Or do you think a creator’s personality will inevitably influence the work he or she makes?
