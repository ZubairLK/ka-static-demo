<p>Video Title : "Modern" art in Victorian times: the late Turner
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Starting around 1835, when he was 60 years old, Turner entered the “late phase” of his life and work. Despite society’s view at the time that he was on the edge of senility–it is said that Queen Victoria thought him quite mad–Turner still travelled extensively. He witnessed new cultures and social scenes, exhibited a supreme confidence in his tools, and created work that was so different from that of his contemporaries that they often didn’t know what to make of it.
Some historians believe that the abstract qualities of late Turner made him a very early precursor to Modernism. Despite creating dramatic new textures and visual experiences, Turner synthesised his earlier experiences without abandoning the interests and methods of his past. Was Turner completely outside his time or old fashioned? Or was he simply being true to himself?
