<p>Video Title : Capturing Turner's colours: Olafur Eliasson's colour experiments
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Often referred to as "the painter of light," what exactly was Turner trying to do with colour and light? Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, known for his pieces exploring elemental materials such as light and air, investigates Turner’s use of colour and light through a series of colour experiment paintings. His interest in Turner’s paintings stems from the artist’s long held interest in atmosphere and dematerialisation. Through analysing pigments, paint production, and application of colour, Eliasson has created visual spaces where the viewers can break away from traditional perspective and hierarchy and simply immerse themselves in the atmospheres of Turner’s paintings.
These colour experiments demonstrate Turner’s continued relevance to and fascination for artists today. Do you get a sense of Turner’s colours and atmospheres in Eliasson’s experiments?
