<p>Video Title : Sigmar Polke
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Snail juice, meteor dust and potatoes... just some of the unusual materials explored by German artist Sigmar Polke. Polke was one of the most significant German artists to emerge in the 1960s, making art in parallel to more "mainstream" Pop in a huge range of materials from painting, drawing and film to potatoes, bubble wrap, and arsenic-based paints. As a young man and self-professed member of a group called the Capitalist Realists, Polke created work that responded to the beginnings of consumer society and popular imagery in West Germany, painting objects like socks, shirts, and plastic tubs in vibrant colours. In the early '60s, Polke worked with halftone images – a printing technique using series of dots, not unlike Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots – taken from newspapers and other popular printed matter. He later shifted to overlaying images, working with larger canvases, and making use of more unconventional materials. Through his work, Polke confronted difficult truths about the world he lived in – such as Nazism and the Berlin Wall – including those of a consumer, image-driven society.

What do you think makes Pop art in Germany so different from more mainstream understandings of Pop, like in the US and UK? Or are the two more similar than they are different?
