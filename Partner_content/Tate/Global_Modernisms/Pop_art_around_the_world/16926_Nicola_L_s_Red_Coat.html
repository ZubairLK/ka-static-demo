<p>Video Title : Nicola L’s Red Coat
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Artist Nicola L was born in Mazagan, Morocco in 1937 and now lives and works in New York City. Since the mid-1960s, her work has been exemplary of what she calls the "other pops", or the engagements with pop art and the ideals of the movement that were thriving beyond the US and UK at the time. Her work often sought a prominent role for women, using it as a language to reflect on what the role of women in society was in the '60s. Influenced by the socio-political upheavals of the time, her practice is mainly based around functional, everyday objects, like sculptures that have been made into chests of drawers. Her work Red Coat (1969) was created for improvised performances in public spaces, and presents the human body as a conceptual piece of art. Stripping its wearers of any particular identity, it immerses them in a communal performance of equality. 

In this film, take a trip around the world with Nicola L's Red Coat. Do you think that Red Coat can be a work of art on its own, or does it need to be animated with people inside of it to be art? When does a body become a work of art?
