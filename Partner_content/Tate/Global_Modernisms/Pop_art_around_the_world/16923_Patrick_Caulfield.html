<p>Video Title : Patrick Caulfield
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you byÂ Tate.org.uk

In the 1960s onwards, British artist Patrick Caulfield radically re-imagined traditional genres such as still life and domestic interiors in his pop art creations. Drawing on the simplified techniques of sign painters, Caulfield dispensed with visual brushwork and distracting detail, simplifying everyday objects to basic black outlines and fills of uniform colour. Through this simplification, Caulfield took ordinary images and turned them into something iconic. Join Tate Director Nicolas Serota and artist Dexter Dalwood as they share their impressions of two of Caulfield's larger works: Interior with a Picture (1985-86) and Dining Recess (1972), which despite their later creation, still have the look and feel of '60s pop art.

What do you think of Caulfield's paintings? Can a simple line drawing still be a great work of art, and even make you see the world in a different way?
