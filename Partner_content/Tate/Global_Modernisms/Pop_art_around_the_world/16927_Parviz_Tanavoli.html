<p>Video Title : Parviz Tanavoli
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Parviz Tanavoli is a pioneering figure of contemporary Iranian art, blending Persian traditions and modern sculpture. Here, the artist talks about his 1975 work Disciples of Sheikh San'an – a woollen rug blending colourful, poppy imagery with traditional techniques – and its related screen prints. Tanavoli’s practice, developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s, is characterised by the incorporation of traditional Persian techniques, notably everyday crafts found in the blacksmiths, foundries and workshops of Tehran, and traditional subjects such as popular love stories from Persian poetry.  His series of screenprints celebrate Persian myths and symbols through a modern visual language.

While he never considered himself a pop artist, Tanavoli worked contemporaneously with pop In the '60s, and other artists saw him as part of the movement. For Tanavoli, "pop art" referred to a universal movement across countries and boundaries. Does an artist really get to choose which movement he or she once belonged to, or is it up to historians to look back and determine the course of art history?
