<p>Video Title : Peter Blake: Studio visit
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Take a look inside the studio of artist Peter Blake, whose 1960s paintings and collages made him a leader of the Pop art movement. Perhaps best known for designing the sleeve cover for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Blake continues to work with pop culture imagery, such as the cut-outs of vaudeville and film starts that populate his latest collage pieces. Through a diverse range of media including collage, painting, sculpture, and graphic work, Blake explores the world of pop idols and stardom. He even pre-dates some of his pop art colleagues, having worked with comic book images before Lichtenstein, and with sculptures of consumer goods even before Warhol.

Blake says that he sees his studio as a museum, and that "the act of collecting is a conceptual art form." When does a collection become a work of art? Can curating and arranging a group of objects be considered an artwork?
