<p>Video Title : Niki de Saint Phalle
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Niki de Saint Phalle was a truly global artist – born in the suburbs of Paris, she lived in New York before moving to Spain, Switzerland, and Paris again. In the 1960s, Saint Phalle emerged as a powerful and original figure in a highly masculine international Pop arts world. She began with highly decorative, colourful paintings before moving on to creative assemblages and landscapes using objects found throughout the household, such as toys, broken plates, and kitchen gloves. Look closely at her Self Portrait (1958), a dark and visibly tortured depiction, and you'll see that her own figure is made up of shards of glass and household trinkets. Like Nicola L and other female Pop artists around the world, Saint Phalle used her work to explore the roles of women in art in society, through pieces such as Shooting Pictures, in which she fired a .22 rifle into bags of paint strapped to a canvas, and the "Nanas", her bold and colourful sculptures of monstrously feminine figures.

We've seen that Pop art was a vehicle for international and women artists to disrupt an art history that they saw as belonging to mostly male artists in a US-UK context. What other ideas do you think Pop art could critique?
