<p>Video Title : What is Pop art?
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

What makes art "pop"? Pop art is a movement that emerged in the 1950s -- in America, Britain, and around the world -- as a revolution against the dominant approaches to art and culture at the time. Seeing the traditional artistic methods, subjects, and media still dominant in art schools and museums, many young artists grew keenly aware of the disconnect between these established practices and the popular culture that defined their everyday lives. So they turned away from tradition and looked to Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music and comic books for their source material, creating a movement that both celebrated and critiqued the consumer culture they lived in. Join actor Alan Cumming as he whips through the history of pop art in America and Britain, from Andy Warhol to Peter Blake.

Can a can of soup be a work of art? Do you think art should draw on the stuff of our everyday lives?
