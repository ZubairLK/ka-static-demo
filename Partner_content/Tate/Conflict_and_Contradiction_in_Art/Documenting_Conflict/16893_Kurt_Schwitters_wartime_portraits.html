<p>Video Title : Kurt Schwitters' wartime portraits
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

After his work was condemned as “degenerate” by the Nazi government, German painter, sculptor, typographer, and writer Kurt Schwitters chose to leave Germany in 1937, escaping first to Norway and eventually to Britain. He was one of many German exiles, including a significant number of artists, who were interned in a camp on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. During his time in the camp and for many years later, Schwitters made hundreds of portraits in an effort to earn a living and document the lives and faces of those not on the front line.

After his release in 1941 he became closely involved with the London art scene, and continued to make portraits of those around him. Take a look at how Schwitters captured the effects of conflict on those beyond the field of battle. What role do you think artists have in documenting not just conflicts and events, but the state of society around them?
