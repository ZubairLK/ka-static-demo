<p>Video Title : Peter Kennard's political photomontages
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Shocking and often made of contradictory images, the photomontages of artist Peter Kennard leave a mark on their viewers. For the past four decades Kennard has consistently challenged power structures and injustice, from his anti-nuclear works of the 1980s to the powerful images he created in response to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kennard has created a legacy of powerful work that stands as an open confrontation to political injustice. He creates montages using images of war, conflict, and what he calls “collateral damage”—usually in the form of human beings—to protest, comment, and reflect upon global conflicts. Join Kennard on a tour of his studio as he explains his work.
Photomontage is a technique in which two or more images are cut and joined together to create a new one. What do you think makes Kennard’s montages so powerful?
