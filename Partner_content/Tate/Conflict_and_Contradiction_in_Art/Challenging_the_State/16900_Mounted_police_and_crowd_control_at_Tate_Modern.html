<p>Video Title : Mounted police and crowd control at Tate Modern
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

In artist Tania Bruguera’s 2007 performance Tatlin’s Whisper #5, unwitting gallery-goers are confronted by mounted police who ride back and forth throughout the gallery space, corralling people and controlling their movements. Visitors who expect to walk freely through the museum are presented instead with a controlled and threatening environment. In this video, the Cuban artist talks about her performance work and explains why, instead of presenting images that can be viewed at a safe distance, she wants people to personally experience the dynamics of power. Performance art has the unique power of being able to activate viewers and invite them to become part of the artwork, giving them a sense of power they might not otherwise experience in a gallery setting. But in this case Bruguera has turned performance art on its head, and instead of empowering her audience she intentionally makes them feel disempowered.





What purpose do you think Bruguera’s performance serves? Is it okay for police to corral and give orders to an audience, whether they like it or not? Do you think an experience like this gives the visitor an opportunity to think about and question the idea of state power without facing real consequences?
