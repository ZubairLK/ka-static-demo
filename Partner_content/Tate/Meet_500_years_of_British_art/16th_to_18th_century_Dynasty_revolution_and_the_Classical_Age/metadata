It all starts here in the 16th and 17th centuries, an era of civil war, plague, a Glorious Revolution, and the birth of the United Kingdom. The following century sees Britain establish itself as a world power through economic growth and colonial ambitions. All the while, British art is flourishing in parallel to these dramatic historical events, shifting from images of family wealth to more personal portraits to scenes of classical drama and ongoing war.
