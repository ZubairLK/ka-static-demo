Take a journey with us. The BP Walk Through British Art offers a circuit of Tate Britain’s unparalleled collection from its beginnings to the present. This "walk through time" has been arranged to ensure that the collection’s full historical range, from 1545 to the present, is always on show. There are no designated themes or movements; instead, you can see a range of art made at any one moment in an open conversational manner.

Walk through time with Tate's curators as they introduce the displays at Tate Britain.
