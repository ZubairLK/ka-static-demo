<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Women_in_Art_and_Art_History/index.html>Women_in_Art_and_Art_History</a></p><p>Across time, space, and culture, in every corner of the globe, women have been involved with making art. Whether as creators and innovators of new forms of artistic expression, patrons, collectors, leaders, sources of inspiration, or significant contributors as art historians and critics, women have been and continue to be integral to the institution of art. Learn about the struggle for women to be recognised as part of the artistic canon, meet the women artists who are shaping the discipline, and see how art can be a platform for tackling women’s issues today.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Conflict_and_Contradiction_in_Art/index.html>Conflict_and_Contradiction_in_Art</a></p><p>As with every other aspect of human life, conflict has served as a focus for art across cultures and eras. Disputes on all scales—national, personal, internal—have made for the subjects of paintings, monuments, and other art forms. What’s so appealing about conflict and contradiction? Take a closer look at art that has engaged with conflict by striving to document (or glorify) it, meet the artists who use art to challenge the status quo, and learn how some art embodies contradiction as a formal quality.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Get_started_and_The_Big_Question/index.html>Get_started_and_The_Big_Question</a></p><p>What is Tate on Khan Academy?

He is best known for his swirling, light-filled Romantic paintings of landscapes, but there is more to this artist and his work than meets the eye. In this topic, meet Turner the man and artist, learn about his greatest works, visit a virtual recreation of his own gallery, and even try your hand at painting and drawing like the master himself. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=The_Art_of_Inspiration/index.html>The_Art_of_Inspiration</a></p><p>Filmmakers, poets, photographers, and designers–they're all artists in their own right. But what happens when some of today's leading creatives come face to face with works of art in the Tate collection? Take a look into the nature of creative inspiration, watch new forms take shape, and have a go at crafting and sharing your own inspired works of art.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Archives_Memory_and_Conservation/index.html>Archives_Memory_and_Conservation</a></p><p>You might think of an archive as a collection of documents and records, files tucked away in boxes, or even the building that houses those records. But what do archives have to do with art? How do we store and preserve the things that artists leave behind, be that actual works of art or ephemera like sketches and drawings? Learn more about the nature of archives, see how artists work with ideas of memory, and go behind the scenes to see how Tate’s team of art conservators bring science into the gallery to fix, preserve, and restore works in the collection. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Performance_and_Participation/index.html>Performance_and_Participation</a></p><p>Where do you draw the line between art and life? These pioneers of performance art have been pushing and pulling on that boundary for decades. Learn about the origins of performance art, listen to artists reflect on how they collaborate creatively, and explore works of art in which you can play a pivotal role.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Global_Modernisms/index.html>Global_Modernisms</a></p><p>Discover a multitude of art histories and practices from around the world at Tate. Learn more and meet these modern and contemporary artists from Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East who are challenging norms, bridging societies, and working and thinking globally.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Meet_500_years_of_British_art/index.html>Meet_500_years_of_British_art</a></p><p>Take a journey with us. The BP Walk Through British Art offers a circuit of Tate Britain’s unparalleled collection from its beginnings to the present.
