With these new voices, some artists have used their work to speak about issues that are unique to them as women, artists, and creative practitioners. Take a look at women artists who create platforms for thinking about gender, sexuality, equality, political rights, and more. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Women_as_Artists/index.html>Women_as_Artists</a></p><p>While women take roles in every aspect of the art world, it is the women artists who have created, crafted, and forged their way forward with their work. In this tutorial, meet some of the female pioneers in painting, sculpture, and ideas of modernism who set the tone for art to come, alongside contemporary women painters, photographers, and professionals whose practices continue to be rich and varied.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=A_Brief_History_of_Women_in_Art/index.html>A_Brief_History_of_Women_in_Art</a></p><p>Despite being engaged with the art world in every way imaginable, many women artists have been invisible in the traditional narrative of art history. They have faced challenges due to gender biases, from finding difficulty in training to selling their work and gaining recognition. Follow the course of this contentious history, from the challenges facing women up through the 20th century, to the campaigns of the feminist art movement, to the continuing work of contemporary women artists.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Activities/index.html>Activities</a></p><p>Want to test your knowledge of art?
