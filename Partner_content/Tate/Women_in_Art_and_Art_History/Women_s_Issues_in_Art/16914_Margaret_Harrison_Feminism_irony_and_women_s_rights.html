<p>Video Title : Margaret Harrison: Feminism, irony, and women's rights
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you byÂ Tate.org.uk

Which is more shocking, a naked women astride a giant banana, or Hugh Hefner in suspenders? Artist Margaret Harrison has been a major female force in the art world since founding the London Women's Liberation Art Group in 1970 and putting on one of the first single feminist exhibitions. Her playful and ironic drawings of men and women were soon banned by the police, but they served as a potent critique of objectification. In her development as a feminist artist, Harrison moved away from the extravagant irony of her earlier work and turned to more political work, pursuing the issue of equal pay for women and turning documentation and research into an art form.
Can art be shocking and meaningful at the same time? Do you think a shock factor is necessary to speak honestly about certain issues?

Take a closer look at Harrison's work in the Tate collection here.
