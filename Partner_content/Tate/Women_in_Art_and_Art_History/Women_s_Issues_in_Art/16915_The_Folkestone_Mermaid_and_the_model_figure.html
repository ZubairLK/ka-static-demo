<p>Video Title : The Folkestone Mermaid and the model figure
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

In a piece for the Folkestone Triennial 2011, artist Cornelia Parker immortalised one local woman in a sculpture perched upon a seaside rock. Parker selected 38-year-old mother of two Georgina Baker as the model of her version of Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid sculpture. Danish artist Edvard Eriksen’s original was cast in 1913, and he created its dainty fairy-tale figure by fusing the physical characteristics of his wife and a ballerina. Parker, on the other hand, modelled her sculpture in the image of a real woman, casting her body in bronze with complete realism, both imbuing her figure with monumentality while turning an idealised character into a real person.
What do you think Parker is encouraging us to think about with this sculpture? Is she defying the notion that only idealised female bodies have a place in art, or perhaps encouraging us to see the everyday as something more heroic?
