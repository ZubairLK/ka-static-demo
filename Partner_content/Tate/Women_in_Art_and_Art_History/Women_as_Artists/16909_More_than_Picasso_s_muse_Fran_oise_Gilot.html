<p>Video Title : More than Picasso's muse: Françoise Gilot
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

At the age of 92, artist Françoise Gilot is brimming with creative energy and continues to paint every day. Back in the 1940s, Gilot was Pablo Picasso’s lover and muse, and a close affiliate with a generation of artists including Henri Matisse, Fernand Leger, and Georges Braque. In this interview from her New York studio, she talks about what her life was like at the centre of French modernism, and how she learned from her peers yet forged her own style even among the superstars of an art movement. As she puts it, "you have to put the energy of your being into the painting.”
Most people are familiar with Picasso, but had you heard of Françoise Gilot before? Why do you think this is?
