<p>Video Title : Biddy Peppin on the female Vorticists
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

The Vorticists were a British art movement that tried to create a new art for a new world, one of big cities, fast machines, and angular energy. The movement included two women, Helen Saunders and Jessica Dismorr, while Dorothy Shakespear was an unofficial member. Join Biddy Peppin, art historian and a relative of Helen Saunders, as she tells us the story of the female Vorticists and the obstacles they faced in being taken seriously as artists. The executor of Dismorr’s will, for example, quite possibly destroyed the artist’s work after her death as he worried it would “casts doubts on her sanity.”




"There was a perception that women were less able to be artists than men.” How do you think Saunders and Dismorr challenged these claims?
