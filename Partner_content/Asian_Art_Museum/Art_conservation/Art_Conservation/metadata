Art conservation work includes treatment and preventive care, scholarly research on materials and techniques, and development of new conservation methods to address the changing needs of a growing museum. The Conservation Center at the Asian Art Museum shares the mandate of the museum to create a deeper level of understanding of Asian cultures by our visitors. Through cooperative exchanges, joint projects, and public outreach, art conservation can provide a unique window into shared traditions of art preservation, restoration and fabrication.
