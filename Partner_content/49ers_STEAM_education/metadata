Established in 1946, the five-time Super Bowl Champion San Francisco 49ers has become recognized as one of the most successful and beloved franchises in the NFL. The team has a rich history of success on the field, but they also make a substantial and positive impact off the field, leading with a long-standing and proven commitment to support education at all levels. The organization is the first in professional sports to design, create and provide accessible, student learning opportunities that revolve around STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, & Mathematics) education in schools and at Levi'sÂ® Stadium. This partnership with Khan Academy represents the pinnacle of creative partnership and program development aimed to connecting and engaging students of all ages to meet real-world challenges head-on through innovation, collaboration, and creative problem solving.
