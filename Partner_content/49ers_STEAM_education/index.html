We may not realize it, but math shows up all the time at work, at home, and is especially found in the game of football. So much of football requires math! From a pass or kick, to the way players move and how plays are called, they all deal with basic mathematical principles and geometry.

Would the game be as interesting without all the colors, the vivid imagery, and the creative design of game-day action? This section answers that question and more by sharing how elements of art and design are interconnected with all aspects of football and how it is celebrated at Levi’s® Stadium.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Related_Khan_Academy_videos/index.html>Related_Khan_Academy_videos</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Technological_advancements/index.html>Technological_advancements</a></p><p>Advances in technology have dramatically changed the way that football is played and watched.
