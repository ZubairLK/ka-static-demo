Then, begin organizing your own financial aid plan with a timeline focused on paying for college.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Work_study/index.html>Work_study</a></p><p>Work-study, one component of a financial aid package, offers you the chance to earn extra funds through on-campus jobs while still going to college full-time.  Hear from admissions on how work-study operates and why it just might be the extra money you need to make college affordable. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Loans/index.html>Loans</a></p><p>College loans can be a scary proposition, because unlike scholarships and grants, they have to be paid back (with interest!) after you finish school.  However, loans also represent an investment in your future and one that can absolutely be worth it if used in moderation.  Learn what sort of loans are out there and how to prioritize between them.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Financial_aid_packages/index.html>Financial_aid_packages</a></p><p>Once a college accepts you, they will take the information that you provided on your financial aid forms to determine your financial aid package.  Now comes one of the most important parts of the college admissions process: comparing offers to determine which of your top schools provided enough aid to make college affordable. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Grants_and_scholarships/index.html>Grants_and_scholarships</a></p><p>Free money?  It might sound too good to be true, but that's just what scholarships and grants - two terms used interchangeably - offer if you put in the time to apply! </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Financial_aid_application_process/index.html>Financial_aid_application_process</a></p><p>Financial aid forms, including the FAFSA and CSS Profile, represent one of the first step in the financial aid process when you are applying to college.  </p></div>
