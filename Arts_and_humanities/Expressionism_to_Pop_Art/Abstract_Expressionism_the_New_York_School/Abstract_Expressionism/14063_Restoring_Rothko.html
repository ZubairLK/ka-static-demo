<p>Video Title : Restoring Rothko
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

What happens when a priceless work of art is vandalised? Filmed over 18 months, this video tells the story behind the restoration of Mark Rothko’s 1958 painting Black on Maroon after it was unexpectedly graffitied in October 2012. Since being damaged, the painting has undergone over a year of intensive restoration work by the Conservation team and colleagues across the gallery. Nine months of research on how to remove ink from the delicate and aged layers of paint, using special solvents and cleaning methods, were followed by nine months of painstaking work on the painting itself.

Would the painting ever look the same again? Is it possible to restore a painting without leaving a trace? Find out on this journey through art, science, and conservation.
