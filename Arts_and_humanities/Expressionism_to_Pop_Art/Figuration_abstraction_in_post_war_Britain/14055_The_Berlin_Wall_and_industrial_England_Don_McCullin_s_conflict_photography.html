<p>Video Title : The Berlin Wall and industrial England: Don McCullin's conflict photography
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Despite having photographed everything from the Vietnam War to the construction of the Berlin Wall, Don McCullin doesn’t like to be referred to as a war photographer. McCullin has been covering events of global importance since the 1960s by placing himself in the heart of the action armed with nothing but a camera. In this video, he speaks about a series of his photographs in which there are no explicit images of war or violence, but traces of more subtle and insidious instances of conflict, such as the ravaging effect of industrialisation on the English countryside or poverty in major cities. His photographs also illuminate an idea that is central not only to photography, but to art in general: the relationship between text and image. If you had seen any of McCullin's photographs without titles, would you know where they took place, who they depicted, or what message they were intended to convey?

For McCullin, the camera can reveal the untold truths of a society. It also serves as a tool for healing, allowing the photographer to not only capture an image through its lens but to engage with its subjects in a unique way. Would you agree? Do you think a camera can change the way you see things?
