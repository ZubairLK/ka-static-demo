<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Melanesia/index.html>Melanesia</a></p><p>To the north and east of Australia lie the islands known as Melanesia. These islands form one of the most culturally complex regions of the entire world, with 1,293 languages spoken across the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and the island of New Guinea (politically divided into Indonesiaâ€™s West Papua Province and the nation of Papua New Guinea). It is also a region of great antiquity.  New Guinea has been settled for around 45,000 years, the Solomon Islands for 35,000 years, and Vanuatu and New Caledonia for about 4,000.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Polynesia/index.html>Polynesia</a></p><p>The islands of the eastern Pacific are known as Polynesia, from the Greek for "many islands."  Set within a triangle formed by Aotearoa (New Zealand) in the south, Hawaii to the north and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the east, the Polynesian islands are dotted across the vast eastern Pacific Ocean. Though small and separated by thousands of miles, they share similar environments and were settled by people with a common cultural heritage. The western Polynesian islands of Fiji and Tonga were settled approximately 3,000 years ago, whilst New Zealand was settled as recently as 1200 C.E.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Micronesia/index.html>Micronesia</a></p><p>The word Micronesia comes from the Greek and means "small" and "island." It contains the island groups north of Melanesia and east of the Philippines including the Mariana, Caroline, Marshall and Kiribati islands.</p></div>
