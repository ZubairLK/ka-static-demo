<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Indigenous_Americas/index.html>Indigenous_Americas</a></p><p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is among the world’s oldest artistic traditions. While its roots lie in northern Asia, it developed independently between c. 10,000 B.C.E. and 1492 C.E., which marked the beginning of the European invasions. Regions and cultures are referred to as the Indigenous Americas to signal the priority of First Nations cultural traditions over those of the colonizing and migrant peoples that have progressively taken over the American continents for the last 500 years.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Ancient_Mediterranean_3500_B_C_E_300_C_E_/index.html>Ancient_Mediterranean_3500_B_C_E_300_C_E_</a></p><p>Artistic traditions of the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt focused on representing royal figures and divinities and on the function of funerary and palatial complexes within their cultural contexts. Works of art illustrate the active exchange of ideas and reception of artistic styles among the Mediterranean cultures and the subsequent influence on the classical world.

While prehistoric art of Europe has been the focus of many introductions to the history of art, very early art is found worldwide and shares certain features, particularly concern with the natural world and humans’ place within it.

Art existed in the context of dramatic events such as industrialization, urbanization, economic upheaval, migrations, and wars. Countries and governments were re-formed; women’s and civil rights’ movements catalyzed social change.

Artists assumed new roles in society. Styles of art proliferated and often gave rise to artistic movements. Art and architecture exhibited a diversity of styles, forming an array of “isms.” Works of art took on new roles and functions in society and were experienced by audiences in new ways. Art of this era often proved challenging for audiences and patrons to immediately understand.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=West_and_central_Asia_500_B_C_E_1980_C_E_/index.html>West_and_central_Asia_500_B_C_E_1980_C_E_</a></p><p>The arts of West and Central Asia play a key role in the history of world art, giving form to the vast cultural interchanges that have occurred in these lands that link the European and Asian peoples.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=The_Pacific_/index.html>The_Pacific_</a></p><p>The arts of the Pacific vary by virtue of ecological situations, social structure, and impact of external influences, such as commerce, colonialism, and missionary activity.
