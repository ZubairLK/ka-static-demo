Teotihuacan culture is best known to us from the vast and ancient abandoned city north of what is now Mexico City. Here are massive pyramids, broad avenues, and complex urban planning that structured the lives of tens of thousands of inhabitants for centuries. Archaeologists are piecing together information from the architecture but also from burials, murals, sculpture and masks to try to better understand the place that the later Aztecs called , the City of the Gods.
