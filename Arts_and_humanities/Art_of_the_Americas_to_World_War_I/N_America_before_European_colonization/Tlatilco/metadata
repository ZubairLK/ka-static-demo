Tlatilco was one village of several spread around the great lake that once formed the center of what is today Mexico City. Tlatilco figurines are wonderful small ceramic figures, often of women, found in Central Mexico from 1500-1200 B.C.E. Some of the motifs found on other Tlatilco ceramics, such as ducks and fish, would have come directly from their lakeside surroundings.
