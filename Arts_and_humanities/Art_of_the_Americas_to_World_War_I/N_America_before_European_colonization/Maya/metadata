The Maya civilization (beginning around 300 C.E.) was one of the most sophisticated in the Americas. It extended from southeastern Mexico across modern-day Guatemala, Belize and the western parts of Honduras and El Salvador. Maya cities usually had a dramatic stepped pyramid and the Maya developed a sophisticated writing system and used an elaborate calendar system. There are about six million Maya today.
