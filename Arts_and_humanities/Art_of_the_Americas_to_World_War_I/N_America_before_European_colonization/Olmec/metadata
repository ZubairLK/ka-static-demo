The Olmecs lived in the low-lying Gulf Coast of what is now Mexico about 1200-400 B.C.E. at sites such as San Lorenzo and La Venta. These and the other Olmec centers included many of the features that would be associated with later civilizations in Central America including the Mexica (Aztecs) and Maya. Alongside impressive architecture, there is evidence of a ceremonial ball game and complex astrological calendars.
