The Chavín culture, named after the highland site of Chavín de Huántar, thrived from 900 B.C.E. to 200 B.C.E. The culture and site centered on a religious cult that had far-flung influence, with pilgrims coming from hundreds of kilometers away. Those same pilgrims often took Chavín-style artworks with them, extending the culture’s artistic influence throughout the Andean region.
