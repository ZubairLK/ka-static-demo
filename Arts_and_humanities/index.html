Islam has been a major religion and cultural force for over fourteen centuries and continues to be so today. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Global_contemporary_art/index.html>Global_contemporary_art</a></p><p>1970-the present: Beuys, Hirst, Hadid and more.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Music/index.html>Music</a></p><p>An exploration of classical music as a living tradition. Top orchestral players from across the United States meet once-a-year in New York as the All-Star Orchestra to record masterpieces and new works with Music Director Gerard Schwarz. Come behind the scenes, meet the musicians, attend an open rehearsal, gain a conductor's perspective, and have a first-person encounter with the music.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Renaissance_Reformation_in_Europe/index.html>Renaissance_Reformation_in_Europe</a></p><p>1400-1600: In part, the Renaissance was a rebirth of interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. It was also a period of economic prosperity in Europe—particularly in Italy and in Northern Europe. In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience, the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Baroque_to_Neoclassical_art_in_Europe/index.html>Baroque_to_Neoclassical_art_in_Europe</a></p><p>1600-1800: The monarchs of Europe embraced the most ornate elements of 17th-century art. Rulers invested vast resources on elaborate church facades, stunning, gold-covered chapels and strikingly-realistic painting and sculpture. While in the newly independent Dutch Republic, a market emerged to meet the Protestant tastes of the growing merchant class. By the 18th century, Voltaire, Rousseau and other intellectuals had put forward Enlightenment ideas that would spark an age of revolution and usher in the modern world.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Art_of_Africa/index.html>Art_of_Africa</a></p><p>Discover the diverse arts of Africa from select cultures and time periods on the world’s second largest continent.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Art_of_Asia/index.html>Art_of_Asia</a></p><p>This section looks at the art and cultures of Imperial China (for ancient China please see the section, "Ancient Art and Civilizations" above), Hindu and Buddhist from South Asia, the great temple and palace complexes of Southeast Asia, and the art and architecture of Korea and Japan. Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker of Smarthistory together with leading art historians, and our museum partners have created hundreds of short engaging conversational videos and articles, making Khan Academy one of the most accessible and extensive resources for the study of the history of art.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Grammar/index.html>Grammar</a></p><p>Grammar is the collection of rules and conventions that makes languages go.

Well, somewhere along that line early man could be shown holding a paint brush and a chisel. Mankind has been making art for at least 100,000 years. Why was the earliest art made? What might it have once meant? "Prehistoric" refers to a time before writing, which makes these questions particularly difficult to answer—but fascinating to contemplate.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Art_in_19th_century_Europe/index.html>Art_in_19th_century_Europe</a></p><p>People use the term “modern” in a variety of ways—often very loosely, with a lot of implied associations of new, contemporary, up-to-date, and technological. The development of capitalism, urban culture, technology, and a growing middle class had an enormous impact on art.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Art_history/index.html>Art_history</a></p><p>We understand the history of humanity through art.

The new test will assess a student’s understanding of the methods used by art historians and familiarity with the cultural context in which a work of art was made and understood. Smarthistory’s art history content is designed to teach these skills and to make the art engaging and accessible (and it’s completely free!). Currently, some 95% of the 250 monuments are discussed in the videos and essays included in this section. We are working to cover the remaining content. New materials are being added regularly. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=World_history/index.html>World_history</a></p><p>From the earliest civilizations to the modern world, geography, religion, trade, and politics have bound peoples and nations together — and torn them apart.
