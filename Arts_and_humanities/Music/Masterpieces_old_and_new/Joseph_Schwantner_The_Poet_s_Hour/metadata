This piece was inspired by the transcendental writings of Thoreau, and the New England landscape. The composer says: "There are mornings when the world seems to begin, it is a 'new beyond' where memory need not go, it’s the poet’s hour. You get up early in the morning, and it becomes an extraordinary invigorating environment in which to lead an artist's life.”
