Music has sometimes reflected, and at other times challenged repressive ideologies.  Dmitri Shostakovich abandoned the premiere of his daring 4th symphony in 1935 for fear of reprisals from the Soviet government. Then he composed his triumphant 5th Symphony in 1937, and Stalin was pleased.  To this day the 5th is Shostakovich’s most popular symphony. What is its message?  What does “political music” mean today?
