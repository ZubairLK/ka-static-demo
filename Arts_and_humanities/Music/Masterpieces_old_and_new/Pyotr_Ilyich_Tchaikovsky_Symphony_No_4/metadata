The 4th Symphony of Piotr Ilâ€™yich Tchaikovsky, composed in 1877-78 when he was 37 years old, is one of the most dramatic works for orchestra. The music reflects the powerful emotions that Tchaikovsky experienced during this most difficult period of his life: forbidden love, a failed marriage, a mysterious patron whom he was never to meet, and the struggle to understand and accept the inevitability of Fate.
