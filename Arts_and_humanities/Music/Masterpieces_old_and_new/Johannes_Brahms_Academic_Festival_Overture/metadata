Although Johannes Brahms never went to a university, he was offered a PhD from the University of Breslau, but he to receive this he had to compose a work for the school. This became the Academic Festival Overture, described by Brahms as a cheerful potpourri of student songs. The overture has the largest orchestration of any of Brahmsâ€™ works, and is among his most charming and optimistic pieces.
