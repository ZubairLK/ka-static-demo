Western histories often looked at the Persians only in relation to their confrontations with the ancient Greeks, but the Persian empire was long-lived, complex and sophisticated. The heart of ancient Persia is in what is now southwest Iran. In the second half of the 6th century B.C.E., the Persians created an enormous empire reaching from the Indus Valley to Northern Greece and from Central Asia to Egypt.
