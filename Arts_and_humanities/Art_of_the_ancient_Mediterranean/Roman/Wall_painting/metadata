Paintings from antiquity rarely survive—paint, after all, is a much less durable medium than stone or bronze sculpture. But thanks to the ancient Roman city of Pompeii we can trace the history of Roman wall painting. The entire city was buried in volcanic ash in 79 C.E. when the volcano at Mount Vesuvius erupted—preserving the rich colors in the paintings in the houses and monuments there for thousands of years until their rediscovery.
