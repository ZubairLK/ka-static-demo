<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Late_empire/index.html>Late_empire</a></p><p>Financial pressures, urban decline, underpaid troops and consequently overstretched frontiers - all of these finally caused the collapse of the western empire under waves of barbarian incursions in the early fifth century C.E. The last western emperor, Romulus Augustus, was deposed in 476 C.E., though the empire in the east, centered on Byzantium (Constantinople), continued until the fifteenth century.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=A_beginner_s_guide_to_ancient_Rome/index.html>A_beginner_s_guide_to_ancient_Rome</a></p><p>Roman art spans almost 1,000 years and three continents. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Ancient_Rome_quiz_/index.html>Ancient_Rome_quiz_</a></p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Early_empire/index.html>Early_empire</a></p><p>In 31 B.C.E. Octavian, the adopted son of Julius Caesar, defeated Cleopatra and Mark Anthony at Actium. This brought the last civil war of the republic to an end. Although it was hoped by many that the republic could be restored, it soon became clear that a new political system was forming: the emperor became the focus of the empire and its people. Although, in theory, Augustus (as Octavian became known) was only the first citizen and ruled by consent of the Senate, he was in fact the empire's supreme authority. As emperor he could pass his powers to the heir he decreed and was a king in all but name.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Middle_empire/index.html>Middle_empire</a></p><p>The imperial system of the Roman Empire depended heavily on the personality and standing of the emperor himself. The reigns of weak or unpopular emperors often ended in bloodshed at Rome and chaos throughout the empire as a whole. In the third century C.E. the very existence of the empire was threatened by a combination of economic crisis, weak and short-lived emperors and usurpers (and the violent civil wars between their rival supporting armies), and massive barbarian penetration into Roman territory.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Republic/index.html>Republic</a></p><p>In legend Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. by Romulus, its first king. In 509 B.C.E. Rome became a republic ruled by the Senate (wealthy landowners and elders) and the Roman people. During the 450 years of the republic Rome conquered the rest of Italy and then expanded into France, Spain, Turkey, North Africa and Greece. Rome became very Greek influenced or “Hellenized,” filled with Greek architecture, literature, statues, wall-paintings, mosaics, pottery and glass. But with Greek culture came Greek gold, and generals and senators fought over this new wealth. The Republic collapsed in civil war and the Roman empire began. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Wall_painting/index.html>Wall_painting</a></p><p>Paintings from antiquity rarely survive—paint, after all, is a much less durable medium than stone or bronze sculpture. But thanks to the ancient Roman city of Pompeii we can trace the history of Roman wall painting. The entire city was buried in volcanic ash in 79 C.E. when the volcano at Mount Vesuvius erupted—preserving the rich colors in the paintings in the houses and monuments there for thousands of years until their rediscovery. </p></div>
