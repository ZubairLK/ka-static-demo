This section looks at the art and cultures of Imperial China (for ancient China please see the section, "Ancient Art and Civilizations" above), Hindu and Buddhist from South Asia, the great temple and palace complexes of Southeast Asia, and the art and architecture of Korea and Japan. Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker of Smarthistory together with leading art historians, and our museum partners have created hundreds of short engaging conversational videos and articles, making Khan Academy one of the most accessible and extensive resources for the study of the history of art.
