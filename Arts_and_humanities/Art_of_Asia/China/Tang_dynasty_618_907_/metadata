The Tang dynasty was long and prosperous and is known as China's golden age. It was a period when China was powerful and engaged in long distance trade across networks that reached western Asia and Europe. This was also a period of improved education, a strong civil bureaucracy, and some of the most revered poetry, painting and ceramics ever made. The Tang dynasty existed from 618 until 907.
