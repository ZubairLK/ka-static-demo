<p>Video Title : Nan Goldin's snapshots of innocence and childhood
</p><p>Video Description : This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk

Nan Goldin began taking photographs as a teenager in Boston, Massachusetts. Her earliest works, black-and-white images of drag queens, were celebrations of the subcultural lifestyle of the community to which she belonged and which she continued to document throughout the 1990s. During this period Goldin also began making images of friends who were dying of AIDS and recorded her experiences of travelling. Her latest work is an intimate investigation into the narrative of childhood, from birth to young adulthood and everything in between.
Goldinâ€™s photographs can be tender and shocking at the same time. What do you think she is trying to say about the human condition in her work?
