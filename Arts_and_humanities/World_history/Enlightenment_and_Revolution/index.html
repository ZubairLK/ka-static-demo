<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=France_s_many_revolutions_and_republics/index.html>France_s_many_revolutions_and_republics</a></p><p>Unlike the American Revolution which fairly cleanly transitioned the United States from British rule to a republic, France's process of democratization was much longer and more painful.  This tutorial gives a scaffold of that (and gives some context for the book/musical/movie "Les Miserables").</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Napoleon_Bonaparte/index.html>Napoleon_Bonaparte</a></p><p>A man with such a huge "Napoleonic complex", that they named it after him.  A military genius with a ginormous ego, some people consider him a hero or a tyrant or both.

France has successfully overthrown Louis XVI in 1789.  It has gone through a many-year period of bloodshed and instability.  The monarch's of Europe are not happy about this "overthrow-your-king" business.  A 5'6'' Corsican establishes himself as a strong military tactician during the wars with other European powers and soon comes to power in France.

This tutorial covers the rise and fall of one of the most famous men in all of history: Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon I).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Haitian_Revolution/index.html>Haitian_Revolution</a></p><p>Yes, you are right. Haiti is not in Europe.  We put the tutorial here because it was a French colony and its own revolution is closely linked to that of France's.

Possibly one of the saddest histories that a nation can have, this tutorial tries to give as much context as possible for the birth of Haiti.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=French_Revolution/index.html>French_Revolution</a></p><p>"Let them eat cake!"  "No, how about we cut your head off instead!"  

The French Revolution was ugly, bloody and idealistic.  This tutorial covers the beginning of the end of the Bourbon rule (actually doesn't really go away for 60 years) and birth of France as a Republic (which will really take about 80 years).</p></div>
