World war I (or the Great War) was a defining event for the 20th Century.  It marked the end (or beginning of the end) of centuries-old empires and the dawn-of newly independent states based on ethnic and linguistic commonality.   It didn't just change the face of Europe, it changed the face of the world.

From the Paris Peace Conference and Treaty of Versailles, we'll see how the end of World War I may have been just the set up for even more conflict in Europe and the world.
