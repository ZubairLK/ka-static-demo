It also marked the beginning of a complex period of fragmentation, civil war and fending off Japanese imperial ambitions.  This tutorial covers everything from the establishment of the Republic of China by Sun Yat-sen to the Warlord Era to the Chinese Civil War between the Chiang Kai-Shek led Kuomintang and the Communists led by Mao Zedong.
