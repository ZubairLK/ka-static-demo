Called the Great War (before World War II came about), World War I was the bloody wake-up call that humanity was entering into a new stage of civilization.  Really the defining conflict that took Europe from 19th Century Imperial states that saw heroism in war into a modern shape.  Unfortunately, it had to go through World War II as well (that some would argue was due to imbalances created by World War I).
