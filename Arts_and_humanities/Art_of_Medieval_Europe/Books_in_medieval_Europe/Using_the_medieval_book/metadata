This tutorial discusses how books were used in medieval times. After a manuscript was produced it came into circulation in a monastery, became part of a private library, or ended up in the hands of a student. Readersâ€™ interactions with books left physical traces, such as wear-and-tear, bookmarks, corrections and marginal notes. They reflect how the book was handled, what was deemed important information, and how that information was used.
