In this tutorial we will dig a bit into Thomas Piketty's popular "Capital in the 21st Century" that attempts to analyze the relationship(s) between economic growth, returns on capital and inequality. Our intent is to neither argue for nor against the ideas in the book, but rather use it as a tool for critical reasoning and discourse.
