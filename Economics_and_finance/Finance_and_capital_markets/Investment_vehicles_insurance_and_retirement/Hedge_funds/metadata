Hedge funds have absolutely nothing to do with shrubbery.  Their name comes from the fact that early hedge funds (and some current ones) tried to "hedge" their exposure to the market (so they could, in theory, do well in an "up" or "down" market as long as they were good at picking the good companies).  Today, hedge funds represent a huge class investment funds.  

They are far less regulated than, say, mutual funds.  In exchange for this, they aren't allowed to market or take investments from "unsophisticated" investors.  Some use their flexibility to mitigate risk, other use it to amplify it.
