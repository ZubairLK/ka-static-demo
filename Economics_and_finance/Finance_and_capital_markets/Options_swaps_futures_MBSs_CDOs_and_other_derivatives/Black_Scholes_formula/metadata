Options have been bought and sold for ages, but finding a rational way to price them seemed beyond our mathematical know-how... until 1973 when Fischer Black and Myron Scholes showed up and gave us the Black-Scholes model.  This work was later extended by Robert Merton and now underpins much of modern finance.
