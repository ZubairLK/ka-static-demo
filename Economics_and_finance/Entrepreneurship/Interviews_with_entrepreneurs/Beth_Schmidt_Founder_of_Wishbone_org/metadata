Beth Schmidt was a Teach for America Corps Member teaching 10th Grade English at Locke High School in South Central, Los Angeles, when she asked her class to write about their passion and an after-school and summer program they wanted to attend. Their essays prompted her to find a way to make these life-changing opportunities available to her students. She started Wishbone to send students to programs that they otherwise wouldnâ€™t be able to afford.
