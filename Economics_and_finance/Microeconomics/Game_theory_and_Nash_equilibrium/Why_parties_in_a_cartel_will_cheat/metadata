You know what Nash equilibrium is (from the other tutorial).  Now we apply it to a scenario that is fairly realistic--parties to a cartel cheating.

A cartel is a group of actors that agree (sometimes illegally) to coordinate their production/pricing to maximize their collective economic profit.  What we will see, however, is that this is not a "Pareto optimal" state and they will soon start producing more than agreed on.
