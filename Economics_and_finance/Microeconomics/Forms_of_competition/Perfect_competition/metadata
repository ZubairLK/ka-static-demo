This tutorial looks at markets that are deemed to have "perfect competition."  This means that there are many players with identical products, no barriers to entry, no advantage for existing players and good pricing information.  Few to no real market completely matches this theoretical ideal, but many are close.  Even the example we use in this tutorial (the airline industry) isn't quite perfect (you should think about why).
