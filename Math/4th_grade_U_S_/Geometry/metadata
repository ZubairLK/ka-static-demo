Finally, we're getting to geometry. We've been waiting for this and hope you have been, too. The foundation of all geometry is the line--so that's a great place to start. From there we'll move into angles, quadrilaterals, and triangles. Our goal here is to get familiar with the basic concepts, skills, and applications of geometry. So jump in and let's go for a ride!
