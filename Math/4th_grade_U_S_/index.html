<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Fractions/index.html>Fractions</a></p><p>Learn how to do basic arithmetic with fractions (add, subtract, and multiply). Also learn about mixed numbers and equivalent fractions, and use this knowledge to compare fractions with unlike denominators.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Place_value_and_rounding/index.html>Place_value_and_rounding</a></p><p>We've been exploring place for a while, thinking about ones, tens, and hundreds. But now we're ready to tackle all whole numbers, including numbers in the thousands, millions, and beyond!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Addition_and_subtraction/index.html>Addition_and_subtraction</a></p><p>Fourth grade is the time to really fine-tune your addition and subtraction skills to the point that you can add and subtract pretty much any multi-digit, whole number!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Decimals/index.html>Decimals</a></p><p>Learn what decimal numbers are, and see how decimals are related to fractions. Along the way, find decimals on the number line, convert between fractions and decimals, and compare decimals.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Geometry/index.html>Geometry</a></p><p>Finally, we're getting to geometry. We've been waiting for this and hope you have been, too. The foundation of all geometry is the line--so that's a great place to start. From there we'll move into angles, quadrilaterals, and triangles. Our goal here is to get familiar with the basic concepts, skills, and applications of geometry. So jump in and let's go for a ride!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Measurement_and_data/index.html>Measurement_and_data</a></p><p>When we measure anything, we do it in human-defined 'units'.  Different units were defined in different places and for different scales.  The two most common are U.S. customary units and metric units. Let's think about how to convert between and among them!  We'll also continue thinking about perimeter and area!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Factors_multiples_and_patterns/index.html>Factors_multiples_and_patterns</a></p><p>We know that 3x2x5 = 30.  So 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30.  30 is a multiple of each of 3, 2, and 5.  If a number only has itself and 1 as factors, then the number is "prime".  Don't worry, this is explained in much more depth in the tutorials in this topic.  We will also explore some mathematical patterns.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multiplication_and_division/index.html>Multiplication_and_division</a></p><p>Let's continue on the multiplication and division adventure that was started in third grade. We'll think about multiplying and dividing with whole numbers and discover that sometimes we have a leftover, or a remainder, when we divide. These tutorials will also help you get comfortable with multiplying multi-digit numbers, long division, and solving word problems. Let's do this people!</p></div>
