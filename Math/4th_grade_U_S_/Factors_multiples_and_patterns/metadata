We know that 3x2x5 = 30.  So 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30.  30 is a multiple of each of 3, 2, and 5.  If a number only has itself and 1 as factors, then the number is "prime".  Don't worry, this is explained in much more depth in the tutorials in this topic.  We will also explore some mathematical patterns.
