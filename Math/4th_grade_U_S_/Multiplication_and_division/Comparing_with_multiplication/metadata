In this tutorial, we look at multiplication and division through the lens of comparison.  For example, say that you are 9 and 3 times older than your cousin.  How old would your cousin be? Multiplying a number times 3 gets you to your age, 9. Can you figure out the answer? We'll go through several exercises together so you get enough practice to feel confident multiplying. By the way, memorizing your multiplication tables helps a lot!
