Example: 7 x 500 = 3500</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multiplication_division_word_problems/index.html>Multiplication_division_word_problems</a></p><p>In this tutorial, we'll start to challenge you with more sophisticated multiplication and division word problems. If you understand mult-digit multiplication and long division, you have all the tools you need to tackle these. May the force be with you!  Common Core Standard: 4.OA.A.3</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Remainders/index.html>Remainders</a></p><p>Some division problems don't work out perfectly. For example, we know that 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. But, what is 7 divided by 3? Or 8 divided by 3? In division problems like these, we're left with remainders.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Division_place_value_and_area/index.html>Division_place_value_and_area</a></p><p>Dividing big numbers can be difficult to wrap your mind around. In this tutorial, we'll learn some visual ways to think through large division problems.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Division_problems_that_work_out_nicely/index.html>Division_problems_that_work_out_nicely</a></p><p>Learn to solve division problems like 3500 รท 50 that work out nicely.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multi_digit_multiplication/index.html>Multi_digit_multiplication</a></p><p>You know your multiplication tables (and basic division) from the 3rd grade and are ready to learn how to multiply and divide multi-digit numbers.  Imagine the possibilities!  This tutorial will make you unstoppable.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Comparing_with_multiplication/index.html>Comparing_with_multiplication</a></p><p>In this tutorial, we look at multiplication and division through the lens of comparison.  For example, say that you are 9 and 3 times older than your cousin.  How old would your cousin be? Multiplying a number times 3 gets you to your age, 9. Can you figure out the answer? We'll go through several exercises together so you get enough practice to feel confident multiplying. By the way, memorizing your multiplication tables helps a lot!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multiplication_place_value_and_area_models/index.html>Multiplication_place_value_and_area_models</a></p><p>Most people learn to multiply, but only a select-few actually understand what the multiplication represents. This tutorial, with the help of grids and area models, will allow you to be part of this elite group.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multi_digit_division/index.html>Multi_digit_division</a></p><p>You know your multiplication tables and are getting the hang of basic division. In this tutorial, we will journey into the world of loooong division (sometimes, referred to as "long division", but that's not as much fun to say). After this tutorial, you'll be able to divide any whole number by a single digit number.</p></div>
