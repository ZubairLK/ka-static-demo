"Students expand their understanding of the number system and build their fluency in arithmetic operations in Module 2. Students learned in Grade 5 to divide whole numbers by unit fractions and unit fractions by whole numbers. Now, they apply and extend their understanding of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions. The meaning of this operation is connected to real-world problems as students are asked to create and
solve fraction division word problems. Students continue (from Fifth Grade) to build fluency with adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing multi-digit decimal numbers using the standard algorithms." EngageNY
