"With their sense of number expanded to include negative numbers, in Module 4 students begin formal study of algebraic expressions and equations. Students learn equivalent expressions by continuously relating algebraic expressions back to arithmetic and the properties of arithmetic (commutative, associative, and distributive). They write, interpret, and use expressions and equations as they reason about and solve one-variable equations and inequalities and analyze quantitative relationships between two variables." EngageNY
