"Module 5 is an opportunity to practice the material learned in Module 4 in the context of geometry; students apply their newly acquired capabilities with expressions and equations to solve for unknowns in area, surface area, and volume problems. They find the area of triangles and other two-dimensional figures and use the formulas to find the volumes of right rectangular prisms with fractional edge lengths. Students use negative numbers in coordinates as they draw lines and polygons in the coordinate plane. They also find the lengths of sides of figures, joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate and apply these techniques to solve real-world and mathematical problems."
