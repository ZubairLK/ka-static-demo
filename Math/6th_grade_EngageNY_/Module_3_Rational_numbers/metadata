"Major themes of Module 3 are to understand rational numbers as points on the number line and to extend previous understandings of numbers to the system of rational numbers, which now include negative numbers. Students extend coordinate axes to represent points in the plane with negative number coordinates and, as part of doing so, see that negative numbers can represent quantities in real-world contexts. They use the number line to order numbers and to understand the absolute value of a number. They begin to solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants, a concept that continues throughout to be used into high school and beyond." EngageNY
