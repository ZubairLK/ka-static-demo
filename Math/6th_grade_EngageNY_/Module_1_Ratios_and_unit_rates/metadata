"In Module 1, students build on their prior work in measurement and in multiplication and division as they study the concepts and language of ratios and unit rates. They use proportional reasoning to solve problems. In particular, students solve ratio and rate using tape diagrams, tables of equivalent ratios, double number line diagrams, and equations. They plot pairs of values generated from a ratio or rate on the first quadrant of the coordinate plane." EngageNY
