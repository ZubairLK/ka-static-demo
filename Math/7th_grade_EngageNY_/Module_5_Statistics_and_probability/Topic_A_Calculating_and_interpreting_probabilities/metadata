Topic A includes lessons 1-7 and covers chance experiments, estimating probabilities by collecting data, chance experiments with equally likely outcomes, calculating probabilities for chance experiments with equally likely outcomes, chance experiments with outcomes that are not equally likely, using tree diagrams to represent a sample space and to calculate probabilities, and calculating probabilities of compound events.
