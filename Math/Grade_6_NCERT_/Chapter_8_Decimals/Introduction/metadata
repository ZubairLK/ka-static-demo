A dot represents a decimal point. In real life problems like measuring of length, weight, or time, the values are not exact whole numbers, but rather portions of whole numbers. In situations where we need to be exact, we use decimal numbers. In this chapter we will learn how to reduce number to 10ths, 100ths of a decimal place, to compare decimal numbers. We will also learn how to add and subtract decimal numbers, and understand how to use them in real life situations.
