Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns in mathematics. It involves usage of letters with numbers to depict problems. In this topic chapter we will learn about Matchstick patters, we will introduce the idea of variables, and we will understand where these variables can be used. A variable is depicted as a letter which can take any value. We will also learn to write linear expressions and ways to solve them.
