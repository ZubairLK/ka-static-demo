Expression like (4x + 5), which contains the variable x, cannot be evaluated. Only if x is given some value, an expression like (4x + 5) can be evaluated. In this topic we will learn how to evaluate exponential equations, we will write expressions variables and learn how to solve them when the value of the variable is specified.
