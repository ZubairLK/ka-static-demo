Two lines that cannot have a common point are called parallel lines. When two intersecting lines make an angle of 90 degrees, they are called perpendicular lines. When two lines intersect and the angle between them is a right angle, then the lines are said to be perpendicular. In this topic we will learn to clearly differentiate between parallel and perpendicular lines and to draw them.
