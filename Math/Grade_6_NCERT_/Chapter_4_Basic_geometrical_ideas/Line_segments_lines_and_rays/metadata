In this topic we will see that a line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two end points. A line segment that goes off on both directions indefinitely is called a line, whereas a line segment that only extends in one direction is called a ray. In this topic we will learn to draw, recognize and differentiate between line segments, lines, and rays.
