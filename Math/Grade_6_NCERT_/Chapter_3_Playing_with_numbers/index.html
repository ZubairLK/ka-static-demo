We will also look into prime factorization and a fundamental theorem of arithmetic.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Factors_and_multiples/index.html>Factors_and_multiples</a></p><p>In this topic we will see that a factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number, and a multiple is a result of the multiplication of that number with another whole number. Let's look at this concept closely!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Highest_common_factor/index.html>Highest_common_factor</a></p><p>We will understand what the we mean by the term "Greatest common divisor" or "Highest common factor", and cover some basic exercises. Let's begin!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Prime_factorization/index.html>Prime_factorization</a></p><p>When a number is expressed as a product of its factors, we say that the number has been factorized. Here, we will look deeper into the concept of prime factorization, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and do a divisibility exercise!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Test_for_divisibility_of_numbers/index.html>Test_for_divisibility_of_numbers</a></p><p>In this topic we will look into how the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 divisibility rules govern the divisibility of a large number. We will also do the 3 and 9 divisibility rules in detail. Let's see what we mean by that!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Some_problems_on_HCF_and_LCM/index.html>Some_problems_on_HCF_and_LCM</a></p><p>Let's look into some applications of Highest common factor (HCF) and Lowest common multiple (LCM), and try to build a better understanding of these topics through some exercises.</p></div>
