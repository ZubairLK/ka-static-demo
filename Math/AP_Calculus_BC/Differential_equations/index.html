The logistic differential equation and logistic function are there to rescue us!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Separable_equations/index.html>Separable_equations</a></p><p>Arguably the 'easiest' class of differential equations.  Here we use our powers of algebra to "separate" the y's from the x's on two different sides of the equation and then we just integrate!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Slope_fields/index.html>Slope_fields</a></p><p>Slope fields are a tool we can use to analyze differential equations graphically. They don't demand any elaborate algebraic tool, which makes them easy to use.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Differential_equations_introduction/index.html>Differential_equations_introduction</a></p><p>How is a differential equation different from a regular one?  Well, the solution is a function (or a class of functions), not a number.  How do you like me now (that is what the differential equation would say in response to your shock)!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Euler_s_Method/index.html>Euler_s_Method</a></p><p>Euler's method is a relatively simple numerical tool for approximating values for solutions of differential equations. It is based on the understanding that a function behaves similar to its tangent around the point where the tangent touches the function.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Exponential_models/index.html>Exponential_models</a></p><p>Exponential functions are described by differential equations of the general form dy/dx=ky, i.e. equations where the derivative is proportional to the function. Learn how to solve such equations and how to solve word problems with real-world contexts involving such equations.</p></div>
