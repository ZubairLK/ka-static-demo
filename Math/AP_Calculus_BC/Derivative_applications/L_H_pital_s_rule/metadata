L'Hôpital's rule provides us with an easy, almost magical way of finding indeterminate limits of quotients of functions using the functions' derivatives. In short, the rule says that if the limits of functions f and g at x=a are 0 (or ထ) and the limit of f'(x)/g'(x) at x=a is equal to L, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) at x=a is also equal to L.
