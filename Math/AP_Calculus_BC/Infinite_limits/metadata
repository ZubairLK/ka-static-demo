Basically, a limit must be at a specific point and have a specific value in order to be defined. Nevertheless, there are two kinds of limits that break these rules. One kind is unbounded limits -- limits that approach ± infinity (you may know them as "vertical asymptotes"). The other kind is limits at infinity -- these limits describe the value a function is approaching as x goes to ± infinity (you may know them as "horizontal asymptotes").
