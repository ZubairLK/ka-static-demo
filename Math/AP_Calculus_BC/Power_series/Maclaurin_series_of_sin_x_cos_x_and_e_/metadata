A Maclaurin series is essentially a Maclaurin polynomial with infinite terms. It turns out that the Maclaurin series of sin(x), cos(x), and eË£ return the exact same values as the functions themselves, for any x-value. Wow! Introduce yourselves to these special series and discover one of the most fascinating areas of all of mathematics!
