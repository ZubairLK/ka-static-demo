If you ever tried to find derivatives using their formal definition, you probably know how tedious that may be. Fortunately, we have ways for finding derivatives much quicker, using differentiation rules! Make your first steps in this fascinating world by working with the more basic rules. For example, the derivative of [f(x)+g(x)] is f'(x)+g'(x), and the derivative of k⋅f(x) is k⋅f'(x).
