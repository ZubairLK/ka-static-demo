It is sometimes easier to take a double integral (a particular double integral as we'll see) over a region and sometimes easier to take a line integral around the boundary.  Green's theorem draws the connection between the two so we can go back and forth.  This tutorial proves Green's theorem and then gives a few examples of using it.  If you can take line integrals through vector fields, you're ready for Mr. Green.
