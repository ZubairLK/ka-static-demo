<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multivariable_chain_rule/index.html>Multivariable_chain_rule</a></p><p>If you have one function that takes a single number to a high dimensional space, and another which maps that high dimensional space back down to the number line, applying one after the other gives a regular old single-variable function.  But how do you find the derivative of this new function?</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Skill_checks/index.html>Skill_checks</a></p><p>Test your knowledge of the various ways to extend the idea of a derivative to multivariable function.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Laplacian/index.html>Laplacian</a></p><p>The Laplacian, also known as the "Laplace operator", is a way to extend the second derivative to multivariable functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Divergence/index.html>Divergence</a></p><p>In the fluid flow interpretation of vector fields, divergence is a measure of how much fluid tends to flow away from each point.  However, his turns out to have far-reaching consequences beyond the specific case of fluid flow.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Curvature/index.html>Curvature</a></p><p>How do you measure how much a curve actually curves?  There are many ways to view the answer to this question, but all land you on the same mathematical quantity, known simply as "curvature".</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Divergence_and_curl_articles_/index.html>Divergence_and_curl_articles_</a></p><p>Divergence and curl are two ways of extending the idea of a derivative to vector fields.

If you interpret a vector field as representing a fluid flow, the divergence tells you if the fluid tends to converge near a given point, or if it diverges away from it.  The curl, on the other hand, measures rotation in the fluid.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Differentiating_vector_valued_functions_articles_/index.html>Differentiating_vector_valued_functions_articles_</a></p><p>What it means to take the derivative (or partial derivative) of a vector-valued function</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Curl/index.html>Curl</a></p><p>Curl is a special version of the derivative for vector fields.  It can be nicely interpreted in terms of rotation in fluid flow.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Partial_derivatives/index.html>Partial_derivatives</a></p><p>The meaning of the derivative is not so straightforward when the input space has multiple dimensions.  Partial derivatives allow us to handle this by restricting movement in the input space.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Gradient_and_directional_derivatives/index.html>Gradient_and_directional_derivatives</a></p><p>The gradient is like the king of all partial derivatives.  Or perhaps it's more like the country they all live it.  It stores all partial derivative information in a single vector-valued function, and as such it is a central tool for analyzing rates of change in multivariable functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Differentiating_parametric_curves/index.html>Differentiating_parametric_curves</a></p><p>In this tutorial, we will explore position vector functions and think about what it means to take a derivative of one.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Partial_derivative_and_gradient_articles_/index.html>Partial_derivative_and_gradient_articles_</a></p><p>There are several different analogs of the derivative for scalar-valued multivariable functions: Partial derivatives, the gradient, and the directional derivative.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Partial_derivatives_of_vector_valued_functions/index.html>Partial_derivatives_of_vector_valued_functions</a></p><p>Learn how to compute and interpret the partial derivative of a multivariable function with a vector-valued output.</p></div>
