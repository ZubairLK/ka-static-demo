You've done some work with line integral with scalar functions and you know something about parameterizing position-vector valued functions.  In that case, welcome!  You are now ready to explore a core tool math and physics: the line integral for vector fields.  Need to know the work done as a mass is moved through a gravitational field.  No sweat with line integrals.
