There are many ways to extend the idea of integration to multiple dimensions: Line integrals, double integrals, triple integrals, surface integrals, etc.  Each one lets you add infinitely many infinitely small values, where those values might come from points on a curve, points in an area, points on a surface, etc.  

These are all very powerful tools, relevant to almost all real-world applications of calculus.  In particular, they are an invaluable tool in physics.
