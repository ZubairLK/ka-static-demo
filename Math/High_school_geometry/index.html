Use this concept to prove geometric theorems and solve some problems with polygons.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Congruence/index.html>Congruence</a></p><p>Learn what it means for two figures to be congruent, and how to determine whether two figures are congruent or not. Use this immensely important concept to prove various geometric theorems about triangles and parallelograms.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Transformations/index.html>Transformations</a></p><p>In this topic you will learn about the most useful math concept for creating video game graphics: geometric transformations, specifically translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations.

You will learn how to perform the transformations, and how to map one figure into another using these transformations.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Geometry_foundations/index.html>Geometry_foundations</a></p><p>Review your knowledge about angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, and area.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Right_triangles_trigonometry/index.html>Right_triangles_trigonometry</a></p><p>Triangles are not always right (although they are never wrong), but when they are it opens up an exciting world of possibilities.  Not only are right triangles cool in their own right (pun intended), they are the basis of very important ideas in analytic geometry (the distance between two points in space) and trigonometry.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Circles/index.html>Circles</a></p><p>Explore, prove, and apply important properties of circles that have to do with things like arc length, radians, inscribed angles, and tangents.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Solid_geometry/index.html>Solid_geometry</a></p><p>Extend your knowledge about two-dimensional shapes to three dimensions!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Analytic_geometry/index.html>Analytic_geometry</a></p><p>In analytic geometry, also known as coordinate geometry, we think about geometric objects on the coordinate plane. For example, we can see that opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel by by writing a linear equation for each side and seeing that the slopes are the same.</p></div>
