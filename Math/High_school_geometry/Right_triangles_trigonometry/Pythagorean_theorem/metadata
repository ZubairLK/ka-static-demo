Named after the Greek philosopher who lived nearly 2600 years ago, the Pythagorean theorem is as good as math theorems get (Pythagoras also started a religious movement).  It's simple.  It's beautiful.  It's powerful.

In this tutorial, we will cover what it is and how it can be used.  We have another tutorial that gives you as many proofs of it as you might need.
