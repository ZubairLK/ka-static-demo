Wait, I'm in Europe and my car only tells my distance traveled in kilometers! But I'm used to a units of distance devised by the Romans to measure the average length of 1000 paces of a soldier (the "mile")! How do I operate? These tutorials are about the fundamental skill of unit conversion. Sal's cousin Nadia being a bit confused with this was actually the reason why he started tutoring her (which led to the creation of the Khan Academy).Â
