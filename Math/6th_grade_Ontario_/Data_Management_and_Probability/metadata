We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability or statistics. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. We are constantly looking at data and charts to understand a multitude of information out there....so here you go! All made simple for you!
