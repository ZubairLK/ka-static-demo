We are surrounded by space. And that space contains lots of things. And these things have shapes. In geometry we are concerned with the nature of these shapes, how we define them, and what they teach us about the world at large. Geometry is at the core of everything that exists--including you. Some of the interesting topics we cover in measurements section: triangles, prisms, quadrilaterals etc. are all actually part of geometry too! Having said all that,  here we'll delve into angles and coordinate planes and more!
