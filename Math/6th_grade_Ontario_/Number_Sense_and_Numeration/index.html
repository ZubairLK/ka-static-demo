<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Fractions/index.html>Fractions</a></p><p>Let's help you relate improper fractions to mixed numbers!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Factors_and_multiples/index.html>Factors_and_multiples</a></p><p>After these videos, understanding the concept of prime numbers and the ones for which you can finding factors and multiples, will be no brainers!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Properties_of_numbers/index.html>Properties_of_numbers</a></p><p>This group of tutorials will introduce us to some of the common properties of numbers, including the least common multiple (LCM), greatest common factor (GCF), and the distributive property. We'll hear really good explanations and practice rewriting expressions so that we can extend our understanding of the properties of numbers and of PEDMAS! All of these will be extremely useful going forward. Really, it's true! </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Place_value_and_decimal_operations/index.html>Place_value_and_decimal_operations</a></p><p>Here we will explore understanding decimals conceptually, using operations with decimals, rounding and estimating with decimals, and converting decimals. And why not go into the fun concepts of manipulating decimals through addition, subtraction, multiplication and division! It really is a breeze once you are done with these videos!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Multiplication_and_division/index.html>Multiplication_and_division</a></p><p>Let's handle slightly more complicated multiplications and divisions. Now you'll become super good at it with a bit more practice! After these tutorials, you'll be comfortable dividing two digit whole numbers and decimals, whether they are in the divisor or dividend position. Pretty exciting, huh? Let me a hear a "Yes!"</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Ratios_rates_and_percentages/index.html>Ratios_rates_and_percentages</a></p><p>A common application of numbers in real life (what is REAL life anyway, huh?) is through ratios, rates, and percentages. Whether following a recipe, changing the oil in a car, or determining the percentage earned on a test...these are skills you will use over and over. Ratios are simply another way to express fractions. Rates combine units of measurements to help us understand their relationship better. Percentages, like ratios, give us another way to express fractions and decimals. We'll explain each to you and then practice until you've mastered each concept.</p></div>
