This group of tutorials will introduce us to some of the common properties of numbers, including the least common multiple (LCM), greatest common factor (GCF), and the distributive property. We'll hear really good explanations and practice rewriting expressions so that we can extend our understanding of the properties of numbers and of PEDMAS! All of these will be extremely useful going forward. Really, it's true!
