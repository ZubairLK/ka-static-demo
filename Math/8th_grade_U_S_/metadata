8th grade is all about tackling the meat of algebra and getting exposure to some of the foundational concepts in geometry.  If you get this stuff (and you should because you're incredibly persistent), the rest of your life will be easy. Okay, maybe not your whole life, but at least your mathematical life.  Seriously, if you really get the equations and functions stuff we cover here, most of high school will feel intuitive, even relaxing.
