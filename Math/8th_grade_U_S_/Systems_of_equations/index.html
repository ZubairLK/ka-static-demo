<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Solving_systems_with_substitution/index.html>Solving_systems_with_substitution</a></p><p>This tutorial is focused on solving systems through substitution.  It has more examples than you can shake a dog at.  As always, pause the video and try to solve before Sal does.  Once you get a hang for things, feel free to skip the rest of the videos and try the exercises.  The best way to learn, after all, is to do rather than just listen!

This tutorial focuses with a ton of examples on elimination. You'll learn best if you pause the videos and try to do the problem before Sal does.  Once you get a hang for things, feel free to skip forward to the exercises.

This tutorial shows you how to solve systems of equations graphically.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Systems_of_equations_with_graphing/index.html>Systems_of_equations_with_graphing</a></p><p>We already know that we can represent the set of all x-y pairs that satisfy a linear equation as a line.  If there is a point where two of these lines intersect, then the x-y pair corresponding to that point must satisfy both equations.

These include rate problems, mixture problems, and others.  If you can pause and solve the example videos before Sal does, we'd say that you have a pretty good grasp of systems.  Enjoy!

This tutorial will take things a bit deeper by exploring cases when you might have no solutions or an infinite number of them.
