This tutorial is focused on solving systems through substitution.  It has more examples than you can shake a dog at.  As always, pause the video and try to solve before Sal does.  Once you get a hang for things, feel free to skip the rest of the videos and try the exercises.  The best way to learn, after all, is to do rather than just listen!
