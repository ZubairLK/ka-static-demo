This tutorial doesn't involve talking parrots and greedy trolls, but it takes many of the ideas you might have learned in that tutorial and applies them to word problems.  These include rate problems, mixture problems, and others.  If you can pause and solve the example videos before Sal does, we'd say that you have a pretty good grasp of systems.  Enjoy!
