In this topic, we will learn about special angles, such as angles between intersecting lines and triangle angles.  Next, we will learn about the Pythagorean theorem.  We will find volume of 3D shapes like spheres, cones, and cylinders.  Finally, we will learn about translations, rotations, reflections, and congruence and similarity.
