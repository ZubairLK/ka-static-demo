In 5th grade, you'll continue to learn about the decimals you learned about in 4th grade, but you'll learn to perform the operations of arithmetic on them: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


Whether you are a robot, possum, magic unicorn, or just a normal human being, 5th grade is incredible!  You will deepen your knowledge of the decimals that you were first exposed to in 4th grade.  In particular, you'll learn to do all the arithmetic operations--addition, subtraction, multiplication, division--with them and really understand what a decimal represents.  This will be complemented by building your fraction muscles where you'll learn to add, subtract, and multiply any fractions (and begin to divide them).  On the measurement front, you'll explore volume (or how much "space" something takes up) and continue the unit conversion journey begun in 4th grade.  5th grade is also the first time that you get exposed to the fundamental concept of graphing points on a coordinate plane, and you'll get a very brief exposure to the concept of exponents (when exploring "powers" of 10)!
