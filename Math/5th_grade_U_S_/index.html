<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Place_value_and_decimals/index.html>Place_value_and_decimals</a></p><p>To really understand how decimal numbers work, we need a deep understanding of place value. The big picture goal of these tutorials is to connect decimal place value to the idea of multiplying by 10.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Algebraic_thinking/index.html>Algebraic_thinking</a></p><p>Arithmetic is fun, but algebra is a blast! Look, nothing is easy the first time you try it so don't get discouraged. These tutorials will give you some straightforward explanations and examples to get you started down the road of algebraic thinking. We'll practice writing and evaluating numerical expressions, as well as seeing, interpreting, and graphing patterns and relationships between numbers. We're laying the foundation for lots of good learning ahead!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Fractions/index.html>Fractions</a></p><p>Learn to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions and mixed numbers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Arithmetic_operations/index.html>Arithmetic_operations</a></p><p>Let's begin our journey together in 5th grade with good ole fashioned arithmetic. Don't assume that this has to be boring...not at all! We're going to have fun as we learn about and practice adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole numbers and decimals. We know you're probably pretty comfortable with basic arithmetic, so we'll try to challenge you a little more in these tutorials!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Geometry/index.html>Geometry</a></p><p>We're going to stick our toes into the proverbial waters of geometry! For those of you that are visual learners you'll love this topic. We'll examine all kinds of lines and shapes in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dimensions. Topics we'll cover include the coordinate plane, plotting points, quadrilaterals, parallelograms, trapezoids, and rhombi (plural for a rhombus). Start your engines!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Measurement_and_data/index.html>Measurement_and_data</a></p><p>If you think about it, we measure almost everything: time, distance, size, weight, volume, etc. Every THING can be measured. The question is, what unit of measurement is used and how is that unit constructed, compared, and converted? This last part is what we explore in these tutorials.</p></div>
