Let's begin our journey together in 5th grade with good ole fashioned arithmetic. Don't assume that this has to be boring...not at all! We're going to have fun as we learn about and practice adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole numbers and decimals. We know you're probably pretty comfortable with basic arithmetic, so we'll try to challenge you a little more in these tutorials!
