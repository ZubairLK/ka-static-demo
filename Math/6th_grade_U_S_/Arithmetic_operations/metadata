The most fundamental branch of math is arithmetic operations. It consists of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers. We're willing to bet that doing these operations on whole numbers is a piece of cake, but now we'll mix those numbers up with decimals and fractions. We'll also introduce the idea exponents as they become much more important moving forward. So sharpen that pencil and relax in your chair, we're going for a ride!
