In statistics, we try to make sense of the world by collecting, organizing, analyzing, and presenting large amounts of data. For example, you may survey your friends about what tv show is most popular, but the small sample size will not give you an accurate idea of what ALL 6th graders like to watch. To do this you must survey a cross section of students from all around the country and all backgrounds. The data can then be statistically analyzed to give a more accurate picture of what tv show is most popular. So let's dive into a discussion of statistics, including box and whisker plots, bar charts, pictographs, line graphs, and dot plots.
