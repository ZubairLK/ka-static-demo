<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Equations_inequalities_introduction/index.html>Equations_inequalities_introduction</a></p><p>Learn about equations and inequalities that have variables in them. These tutorials focus on solving equations and understanding solutions to inequalities.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Ratios_rates_percentages/index.html>Ratios_rates_percentages</a></p><p>Ratios, rates, and percentages are some of the most useful math concepts in real life (and what is REAL life anyway, huh?). From baking recipes to sports, these concepts wiggle their way into our lives on a daily basis.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Arithmetic_operations/index.html>Arithmetic_operations</a></p><p>The most fundamental branch of math is arithmetic operations. It consists of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers. We're willing to bet that doing these operations on whole numbers is a piece of cake, but now we'll mix those numbers up with decimals and fractions. We'll also introduce the idea exponents as they become much more important moving forward. So sharpen that pencil and relax in your chair, we're going for a ride!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Geometry/index.html>Geometry</a></p><p>Learn how to find the area, volume, and surface area of all sorts of geometric shapes. Also work with shapes on the coordinate plane.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Properties_of_numbers/index.html>Properties_of_numbers</a></p><p>Learn how to find the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common factor (GCF).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Data_and_statistics/index.html>Data_and_statistics</a></p><p>In statistics, we try to make sense of the world by collecting, organizing, analyzing, and presenting large amounts of data. For example, you may survey your friends about what tv show is most popular, but the small sample size will not give you an accurate idea of what ALL 6th graders like to watch. To do this you must survey a cross section of students from all around the country and all backgrounds. The data can then be statistically analyzed to give a more accurate picture of what tv show is most popular. So let's dive into a discussion of statistics, including box and whisker plots, bar charts, pictographs, line graphs, and dot plots.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Negative_numbers/index.html>Negative_numbers</a></p><p>Negative numbers are a necessary part of our understanding of mathematics and the world. The idea of anything "negative" is often seen as "bad." Negative numbers are not only good, but they're fun! Walk through this tutorial with us and we'll show you how they are defined, interpreted, and applied. Absolute value is a type of negative number that is expressed as a positive. Confused? Don't be. We got your back.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Equivalent_expressions/index.html>Equivalent_expressions</a></p><p>Learn how we can combine like terms and use the distributive property to create equivalent expressions. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Variables_expressions_introduction/index.html>Variables_expressions_introduction</a></p><p>Learn what variables are and practice using them in expressions. The major concepts covered in these tutorials are substitution, the distributive property, and combining like terms.</p></div>
