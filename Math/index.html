One can spend a lifetime studying and exploring it (and some people do).  If you're not one of them, and are looking to learn, review or practice the most core ideas in Algebra, you've found your home.

This subject is ideal for anyone looking to prepare for a high school or college placement exam.  It covers all of the foundational ideas in algebra and related topics in pre-algebra and geometry.

If you're looking for more exhaustive coverage, then the Algebra I & II subjects may be better for you.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=AP_Calculus_BC/index.html>AP_Calculus_BC</a></p><p>This class covers all of AP Calc BC, from limits to Taylor series.

It's the most important skill we learn in our early years, and it becomes the foundation for all other math concepts. Once we can count, we can add, subtract, and measure the world around us. Shortly thereafter, we learn about place values, graphs, time, money, and shapes.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Algebra_II/index.html>Algebra_II</a></p><p>Your studies in algebra 1 have built a solid foundation from which you can explore linear equations, inequalities, and functions. In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe.  We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices. Don't let these big words intimidate you. We're on this journey with you!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Statistics_and_probability/index.html>Statistics_and_probability</a></p><p>We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=4th_grade_U_S_/index.html>4th_grade_U_S_</a></p><p>4th grade is the time to start really fine-tuning your arithmetic skills.  Not only will you be a multi-digit addition and subtraction rockstar, but you'll extend the multiplication and division that you started in 3rd grade to several digits.  You'll also discover that you sometimes have something left over (called a "remainder") when you divide.    In 3rd grade you learned what a fraction is.  Now you'll start adding, subtracting, multiplying, and comparing them.  You'll also see how they relate to decimals.   On other fronts, you'll learn how to convert between different units (which is super important when comparing the size and speed of robot unicorns in different countries) and continue your journey thinking about various shapes in two dimensions.  Some of the foundational concepts of geometry (like lines, rays and angles) also get introduced.   As always, we'll round this out with a healthy dose of applied word problems and explorations of number patterns and properties (including the ideas of factors, multiples and prime numbers).  The fun must not stop!

Whether you are a robot, possum, magic unicorn, or just a normal human being, 5th grade is incredible!  You will deepen your knowledge of the decimals that you were first exposed to in 4th grade.  In particular, you'll learn to do all the arithmetic operations--addition, subtraction, multiplication, division--with them and really understand what a decimal represents.  This will be complemented by building your fraction muscles where you'll learn to add, subtract, and multiply any fractions (and begin to divide them).  On the measurement front, you'll explore volume (or how much "space" something takes up) and continue the unit conversion journey begun in 4th grade.  5th grade is also the first time that you get exposed to the fundamental concept of graphing points on a coordinate plane, and you'll get a very brief exposure to the concept of exponents (when exploring "powers" of 10)!

It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground.

7th grade is also when you start thinking about probability (which is super important for realizing that casinos and lotteries are really just ways of taking money away from people who don't know probability) and dig deeper into the world of data and statistics. 

Onward!
