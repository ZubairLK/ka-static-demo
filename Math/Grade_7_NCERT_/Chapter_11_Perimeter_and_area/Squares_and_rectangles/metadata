The perimeter of a square of side A is equal to four times one of its side (4XA), whereas, the perimeter of a rectangle with length L and breadth B is two times the sum of two adjacent sides(2 X [L+B] ). Area of a rectangle is the product of its length and breadth (LXB), whereas, Area of a square is the square of its side (A X A). All this you have already studied in previous classes, let's see how much you remember!
