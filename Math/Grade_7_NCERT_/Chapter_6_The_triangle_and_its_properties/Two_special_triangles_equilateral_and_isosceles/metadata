Here we will learn two special types of triangles: Equilateral and Isosceles. A triangle in which all the three sides are of equal lengths and the measure of each angle is 60 degree is called an 'equilateral' triangle , whereas a triangle with two sides equal is called 'Isosceles'. Also, the angles opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal and on the basis of this property, we are going to find missing angles of triangles.
