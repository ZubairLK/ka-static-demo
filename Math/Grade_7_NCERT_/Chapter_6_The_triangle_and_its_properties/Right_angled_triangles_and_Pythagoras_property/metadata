A right-angled triangle is the one in which the measure of one of the angles is 90 degrees. In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is called Pythagorean Theorem. If the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled.
