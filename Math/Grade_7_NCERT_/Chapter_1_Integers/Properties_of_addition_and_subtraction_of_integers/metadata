In this topic we will understand the properties of addition and subtraction of integers, like Commutative Law of Addition, which says that the two numbers can be added in any order--but this does not hold true for subtraction. Apart from this, we will study various other properties like Commutative Property, Associative Law, and that subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive.
