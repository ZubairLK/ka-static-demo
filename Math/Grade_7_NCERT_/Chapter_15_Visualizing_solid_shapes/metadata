Can you see that, the two dimensional figures can be identified as the faces of the three dimensional shapes? For example a cylinder has two faces which are circles, and a pyramid, shaped like this has triangles as its faces.We will now try to see how some of these 3-D shapes can be visualised on a 2D- surface, that is, on paper.
