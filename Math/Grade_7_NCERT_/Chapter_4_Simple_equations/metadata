An equation is a statement that helps us understand the equality between two or more variables, and constants. A variable can take various values. Its value is not fixed. We use letters x, y, l, m, ... etc. to denote variables. On the other hand, a constant has a fixed value. x+3=7 is an equation where x is a variable and 3 and 7 are constants.
