Rational expressions are like fractions, but instead of integers in the numerator and the denominator, you have variable expressions! Learn how to work with such expressions. Namely, simplify, add, subtract, multiply, and divide them (much like fractions!). Then, solve some equations with rational expressions in them, and analyze the behavior of rational functions.
