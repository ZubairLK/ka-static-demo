"It is in Mathematics III that students pull together and apply the accumulation of learning that they have from their previous courses [...] Students expand their repertoire of functions to include polynomial, rational, and radical functions. They expand their study of right triangle trigonometry to include general triangles. And, finally, students bring together all of their experience with functions and geometry to create models and solve contextual problems." - Common Core State Standards (Appendix A)
