<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Exponential_logarithmic_functions/index.html>Exponential_logarithmic_functions</a></p><p>Learn about logarithms, which are the inverses of exponents. Use logarithms to solve various equations. Then analyze both logarithmic and exponential functions and their graphs.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Manipulating_functions/index.html>Manipulating_functions</a></p><p>A great cook knows how to take basic ingredients and prepare a delicious meal. In this topic, you will become function-chefs! You will learn how to combine functions with arithmetic operations and how to compose functions. You will also learn how to transform functions in ways that shift, reflect, or stretch their graphs. Finally, you will learn about inverse functions and how to find them!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Normal_distributions/index.html>Normal_distributions</a></p><p>A Normal distribution is a very special and common distribution that is fundamental to learning about statistics. Normal distributions describe many real world phenomena from scores on exams to lengths of wings on bugs.  </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Radical_equations_functions/index.html>Radical_equations_functions</a></p><p>In this topic you will learn how to solve radical equations (which are equations with radical expressions in them) while avoiding extraneous solutions. You will also learn how to graph radical functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Series/index.html>Series</a></p><p>Extend your knowledge about sequences into series, which are sums of terms in sequences.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Rational_expressions_equations_functions/index.html>Rational_expressions_equations_functions</a></p><p>Rational expressions are like fractions, but instead of integers in the numerator and the denominator, you have variable expressions! Learn how to work with such expressions. Namely, simplify, add, subtract, multiply, and divide them (much like fractions!). Then, solve some equations with rational expressions in them, and analyze the behavior of rational functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Polynomial_expressions_equations_functions/index.html>Polynomial_expressions_equations_functions</a></p><p>Learn how to manipulate polynomials in order to prove identities and find the zeros of those polynomials. Use this knowledge to solve polynomial equations and graph polynomial functions. Learn about symmetry of functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Binomial_probability/index.html>Binomial_probability</a></p><p>If you roll five dice, what’s the probability that three of them show a 6? In a group of 20 strangers, what’s the probability that more than half of them were born in the summer? Learn about binomial probability to answer these types of problems.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Study_Design/index.html>Study_Design</a></p><p>Getting reliable data is vital if we want to make correct conclusions.The process of collecting data through studies involves sampling, observations, surveys, and experiments.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Trigonometric_functions/index.html>Trigonometric_functions</a></p><p>Learn about the definition of the basic trigonometric functions (sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x)), and use advanced trigonometric functions for various purposes.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Advanced_equations_functions/index.html>Advanced_equations_functions</a></p><p>Solve advanced equations by graphing. Interpret advanced features of functions (like symmetry, end behavior, and periodicity) in terms of their context, and compare features of various types of functions.</p></div>
