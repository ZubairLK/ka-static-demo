You can use a transformation/function to map from one set to another, but can you invert it?  In other words, is there a function/transformation that given the output of the original mapping, can output the original input (this is much clearer with diagrams).  

This tutorial addresses this question in a linear algebra context.  Since matrices can represent linear transformations, we're going to spend a lot of time thinking about matrices that represent the inverse transformation.
