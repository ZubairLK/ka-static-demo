You've explored perpendicular bisectors and angle bisectors, but you're craving to study lines that intersect the vertices of a a triangle AND bisect the opposite sides.  Well, you're in luck because that (medians) is what we are going to study in this tutorial.  We'll prove here that the medians intersect at a unique point (amazing!) called the centroid and divide the triangle into six mini triangles of equal area (even more amazing!).  The centroid also always happens to divide all the medians in segments with lengths at a 1:2 ration (stupendous!).
