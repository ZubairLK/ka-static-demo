Ok.  You knew triangles where cool, but you never imagined they were this cool!  Well, this tutorial will take things even further.  After perpendicular bisectors, angle bisector and medians, the only other thing (that I can think of) is a line that intersects a vertex and the opposite side (called an altitude).  As we'll see, these are just as cool as the rest and, as you may have guessed, intersect at a unique point called the orthocenter (unbelievable!).
