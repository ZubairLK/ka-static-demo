<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_5_Data_handling/index.html>Chapter_5_Data_handling</a></p><p>In this chapter we will learn about interpreting data in interesting ways. We will learn how to read and depict data on bars, graphs and charts, and we will also introduce the topic of probability. Probability is used in our daily life, so we will look into it in detail by practicing with many questions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_1_Rational_numbers/index.html>Chapter_1_Rational_numbers</a></p><p>Rational numbers can be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero. In this chapter we will look at some properties of rational numbers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_12_Exponents_and_powers/index.html>Chapter_12_Exponents_and_powers</a></p><p>Exponents are shorthand for repeated multiplication of the same thing by itself, and it's power refers to the number of times it is multiplied. In this chapter we will learn about the basics of exponents and introduce the concept of powers with negative exponents.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_16_Playing_with_numbers/index.html>Chapter_16_Playing_with_numbers</a></p><p>You have studied various types of numbers such as natural numbers, whole numbers, integers and rational numbers.You have also studied a number of interesting properties about them. In grade 6, we explored finding factors and multiples and the relationships among them. In this chapter, we will explore numbers in more detail. These ideas help in justifying tests of divisibility.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_6_Squares_and_square_roots/index.html>Chapter_6_Squares_and_square_roots</a></p><p>A square of an integer is the product of some integer with itself. Similarly, the square root of a number is an integer which when multiplied with itself give this number. In this topic we will increase our understanding of squares, square roots, and will will learn about ways of finding them.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_11_Mensuration/index.html>Chapter_11_Mensuration</a></p><p>The part of geometry concerned with ascertaining lengths, areas, and volumes, is called Mensuration. In this chapter we will add to what we have already studied in previous classes by learning about new shapes like Cube, Cuboid, Cylinder and their volumes.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_14_Factorization/index.html>Chapter_14_Factorization</a></p><p>Factorization is the decomposition of an object (for example, a number, a polynomial) into a product of other objects, or factors, which when multiplied together give the original. In this chapter we will learn about methods of factorization.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_9_Algebraic_expressions_and_identities/index.html>Chapter_9_Algebraic_expressions_and_identities</a></p><p>An algebraic expression is an expression built up from integer constants, variables, and the algebraic operations. In this chapter we will learn about expressions, factors, coefficients, monomials, binomials, and polynomials.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_13_Direct_and_inverse_proportions/index.html>Chapter_13_Direct_and_inverse_proportions</a></p><p>Two values are said to be in direct proportion when increase in one results in an increase in the other. Similarly, they are said to be in indirect proportion when the increase in one results in a decrease in the other. I this chapter we will learn more about these properties.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_7_Cubes_and_cubes_roots/index.html>Chapter_7_Cubes_and_cubes_roots</a></p><p>We get the cube of a number by finding the result of its multiplication with itself three times. Similarly, we can find the original number from this result by finding the cube root. In this topic we will learn more about cubes and cube roots.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_2_Linear_equations_in_one_variable/index.html>Chapter_2_Linear_equations_in_one_variable</a></p><p>Equations having variables with the highest power as '1' are called linear equations, for example 2x+7=3. Here the power of x is 1. In this chapter we will introduce the concept of equations with variables on both sides, and we will look into some applications for linear equations.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_3_Understanding_quadrilaterals/index.html>Chapter_3_Understanding_quadrilaterals</a></p><p>A quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon with four angles. There are many kinds of quadrilaterals. The five most common types are the parallelogram, the rectangle, the square, the trapezoid, and the rhombus. In this chapter we will learn about polygons, different types of quadrilaterals, and the special case of parallelograms!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chapter_15_Introduction_to_graphs/index.html>Chapter_15_Introduction_to_graphs</a></p><p>Graphs are a graphical depiction of data, or relation between two or more variables. In this chapter we will learn about linear graphs, coordinates, and some applications. We will see that data becomes very easy to understand and interpret when depicted through graphs!</p></div>
