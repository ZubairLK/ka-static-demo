Topic C includes lessons 10-15.  "Find the area of rectangles with whole-by-mixed and whole-by-fractional number side lengths by tiling, record by drawing, and relate to fraction multiplication.  Find the area of rectangles with mixed-by-mixed and fraction-by-fraction side lengths by tiling, record by drawing, and relate to fraction multiplication.  Measure to find the area of rectangles with fractional side lengths.  Multiply mixed number factors, and relate to the distributive property and area model.  Solve real world problems involving area of figures with fractional side lengths using visual models and/or equations.  Solve real world problems involving area of figures with fractional side lengths using visual models and/or equations." EngageNY
