"Find the area of rectangles with whole-by-mixed and whole-by-fractional number side lengths by tiling, record by drawing, and relate to fraction multiplication.  Find the area of rectangles with mixed-by-mixed and fraction-by-fraction side lengths by tiling, record by drawing, and relate to fraction multiplication.  Measure to find the area of rectangles with fractional side lengths.  Multiply mixed number factors, and relate to the distributive property and area model.  Solve real world problems involving area of figures with fractional side lengths using visual models and/or equations.  Solve real world problems involving area of figures with fractional side lengths using visual models and/or equations." EngageNY

"Use multiplication to calculate volume.  Use multiplication to connect volume as packing with volume as filling.  Find the total volume of solid figures composed of two non-overlapping rectangular prisms.  Solve word problems involving the volume of rectangular prisms with whole number edge lengths.  Apply concepts and formulas of volume to design a sculpture using rectangular prisms within given parameters." EngageNY
