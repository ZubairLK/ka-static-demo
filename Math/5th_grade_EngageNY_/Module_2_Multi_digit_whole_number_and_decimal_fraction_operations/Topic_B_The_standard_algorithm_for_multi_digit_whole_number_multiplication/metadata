Topic B includes lessons 3-9.  "Write and interpret numerical expressions, and compare expressions using a visual model.  Convert numerical expressions into unit form as a mental strategy for multi-digit multiplication.  Connect visual models and the distributive property to partial products of the standard algorithm without renaming.  Connect area models and the distributive property to partial products of the standard algorithm with renaming.  Connect area models and the distributive property to partial products of the standard algorithm with renaming.  Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm and using estimation to check for reasonableness of the product.  Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm to solve multi-step word problems." EngageNY
