Topic F includes lessons 19-23.  "Divide two- and three-digit dividends by multiples of 10 with single-digit quotients and make connections to a written method.  Divide two- and three-digit dividends by two-digit divisors with single-digit quotients and make connections to a written method.  Divide two- and three-digit dividends by two-digit divisors with single-digit quotients and make connections to a written method.  Divide three- and four-digit dividends by two-digit divisors resulting in two- and three-digit quotients, reasoning about the decomposition of successive remainders in each place value.  Divide three- and four-digit dividends by two-digit divisors resulting in two- and three-digit quotients, reasoning about the decomposition of successive remainders in each place value." EngageNY
