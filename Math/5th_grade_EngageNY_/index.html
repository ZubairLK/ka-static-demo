Volume is introduced to students through concrete exploration of cubic units and culminates with the development of the volume formula for right rectangular prisms.  The second half of the module turns to extending students’ understanding of two-dimensional figures.  Students combine prior knowledge of area with newly acquired knowledge of fraction multiplication to determine the area of rectangular figures with fractional side lengths.  They then engage in hands-on construction of two-dimensional shapes, developing a foundation for classifying the shapes by reasoning about their attributes.  This module fills a gap between Grade 4’s work with two-dimensional figures and Grade 6’s work with volume and area."

This module marks a significant shift away from the elementary grades’ centrality of base ten units to the study and use of the full set of fractional units from Grade 5 forward, especially as applied to algebra." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_6_Problem_solving_with_the_coordinate_plane/index.html>Module_6_Problem_solving_with_the_coordinate_plane</a></p><p>"In this module, students develop a coordinate system for the first quadrant of the coordinate plane and use it to solve problems.  Students use the familiar number line as an introduction to the idea of a coordinate and construct two perpendicular number lines to create a coordinate system on the plane.  They see that just as points on the line can be located by their distance from 0, the plane’s coordinate system can be used to locate and plot points using two coordinates.  They then use the coordinate system to explore relationships between points, ordered pairs, patterns, lines and, more abstractly, the rules that generate them.  This study culminates in an exploration of the coordinate plane in real-world applications."

Topic A opens the module with an exploration of fractional measurement.  Students construct line plots by measuring the same objects using three different rulers accurate to 12 , 14 , and 18  of an inch (5.MD.2)." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_1_Place_value_and_decimal_fractions/index.html>Module_1_Place_value_and_decimal_fractions</a></p><p>"In Module 1, students’ understandings of the patterns in the base ten system are extended from Grade 4’s work with place value to include decimals to the thousandths place.  In Grade 5, students deepen their knowledge through a more generalized understanding of the relationships between and among adjacent places on the place value chart, e.g., 1 tenth times any digit on the place value chart moves the digit one place value to the right (5.NBT.1).  Toward the module’s end, students apply these new understandings as they reason about and perform decimal operations through the hundredths place."  EngageNY</p></div>
