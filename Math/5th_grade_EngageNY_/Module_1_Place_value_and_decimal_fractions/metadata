"In Module 1, students’ understandings of the patterns in the base ten system are extended from Grade 4’s work with place value to include decimals to the thousandths place.  In Grade 5, students deepen their knowledge through a more generalized understanding of the relationships between and among adjacent places on the place value chart, e.g., 1 tenth times any digit on the place value chart moves the digit one place value to the right (5.NBT.1).  Toward the module’s end, students apply these new understandings as they reason about and perform decimal operations through the hundredths place."  EngageNY
