When we are trying to make a judgement about a population, it is often impractical (or impossible) to observe every member of the population.  Imagine trying to survey all 300+ million Americans to understand the likely outcome of the next presidential election!  Because of this, much of statistics is collecting data from a representative and random sample.  From the data collected from this random sample we can infer things about the greater population.
