7th grade takes much of what you learned in 6th grade to an entirely new level.  In particular, you'll now learn to do everything with negative numbers (we're talking everything--adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, decimals... everything!).  You'll also take your algebraic skills to new heights by tackling two-step equations.

7th grade is also when you start thinking about probability (which is super important for realizing that casinos and lotteries are really just ways of taking money away from people who don't know probability) and dig deeper into the world of data and statistics. 

Onward!
