We're going to mix it up a little in this set of examples. Remember that a rational number is a real number that can be written as a simple fraction, or by extension a decimal or percentage. We have to be able to add and subtract numbers when they are in different formats, whether fraction, decimal or percentage. This gets to be fun as learn to move between these expressions of rational numbers, and start to understand they're all pointing to same thing!  Common Core Standards: 7.NS.A.1d
