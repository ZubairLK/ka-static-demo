A common application of numbers in real life (what is REAL life anyway, huh?) is through ratios, rates, and percentages. Whether following a recipe, changing the oil in a car, or determining the percentage earned on a test...these are skills you will use over and over. Ratios are simply another way to express fractions. Rates combine units of measurements to help us understand their relationship better. Percentages, like ratios, give us another way to express fractions and decimals. We'll explain each to you and then practice until you've mastered each concept.
