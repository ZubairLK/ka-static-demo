<div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Number/index.html>Number</a></p><p>The most fundamental branch of math is having a clear idea on number sense and numeration. It consists of understanding place values, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers. We're willing to bet that doing these operations on whole numbers is a piece of cake, but now we'll mix those numbers up with decimals and fraction and exciting concepts like ratios and percentages. So sharpen that pencil and relax in your chair, we're going for a ride!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Statistics_and_Probability/index.html>Statistics_and_Probability</a></p><p>We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability or statistics. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We constantly making predictions and looking at data around us: here's a bit on line graphs and probabilities!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Patterns_and_Relations/index.html>Patterns_and_Relations</a></p><p>One of the fundamentals of algebra is learning to recognize patterns among numbers and being able to visualize those patterns and relationships. So...let's use some mathematical tools to visualize, interpret, and graph patterns involving the coordinate plane. Trust us, this sounds a lot more complicated than it really is. Just follow along and pause the videos as necessary. </p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Shape_and_Space/index.html>Shape_and_Space</a></p><p>If you think about it, we are surrounded by shapes! And did you know EVERYTHING can be measured? Whether 3D or 2D! And wait....how about how shapes move? Transformations! Lets explore it all!</p></div>
