"In this module, students use place value understanding and visual representations to solve multiplication and division problems with multi-digit numbers.  As a key area of focus for Grade 4, this module moves slowly but comprehensively to develop studentsâ€™ ability to reason about the methods and models chosen to solve problems with multi-digit factors and dividends."
