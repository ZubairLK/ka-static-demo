Topic G includes lessonsn 26-33.  "Divide multiples of 10, 100, and 1,000 by single-digit numbers.  Represent and solve division problems with up to a three-digit dividend numerically and with place value disks requiring decomposing a remainder in the hundreds place. Represent and solve three-digit dividend division with divisors of 2, 3, 4, and 5 numerically.  Represent numerically four-digit dividend division with divisors of 2, 3, 4, and 5, decomposing a remainder up to three times.  Solve division problems with a zero in the dividend or with a zero in the quotient.  Interpret division word problems as either number of groups unknown or group size unknown.  Interpret and find whole number quotients and remainders to solve one-step division word problems with larger divisors of 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Explain the connection of the area model of division to the long division algorithm for three- and four-digit dividends."  EngageNY
