"This module gives students their first opportunity to explore decimal numbers via their relationship to decimal fractions, expressing a given quantity in both fraction and decimal forms.  Utilizing the understanding of fractions developed throughout Module 5, students apply the same reasoning to decimal numbers, building a solid foundation for Grade 5 work with decimal operations. Previously referred to as whole numbers, all numbers written in the base-ten number system with place value units that are powers of 10 are henceforth referred to as decimal numbers, a set which now includes tenths and hundredths (e.g., 1, 15, 248, 0.3, 3.02, and 24.35)."
