Topic B includes lessons 4-8.  "Use meters to model the decomposition of one whole into hundredths. Represent and count hundredths.  Model the equivalence of tenths and hundredths using the area model and place value disks.  Use the area model and number line to represent mixed numbers with units of ones, tenths, and hundredths in fraction and decimal forms.  Model mixed numbers with units of hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, and hundredths in expanded form and on the place value chart.  Use understanding of fraction equivalence to investigate decimal numbers on the place value chart expressed in different units."  EngageNY
