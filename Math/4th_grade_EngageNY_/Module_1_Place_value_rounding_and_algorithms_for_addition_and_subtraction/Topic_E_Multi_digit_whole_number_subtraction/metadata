Topic E includes lessons 13-15.  "Use place value understanding to decompose to smaller units once using the standard subtraction algorithm and apply the algorithm to solve word problems using tape diagrams.  Use place value understanding to decompose to smaller units up to 3 times using the standard subtraction algorithm, and apply the algorithm to solve word problems using tape diagrams.  Use place value understanding to fluently decompose to smaller units multiple times in any place using the standard subtraction algorithm, and apply the algorithm to solve word problems using tape diagrams.  Solve two-step word problems using the standard subtraction algorithm fluently modeled with tape diagrams and assess the reasonableness of answers using rounding."  EngageNY
