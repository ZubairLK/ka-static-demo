They begin with large numbers using familiar units (hundreds and thousands) and develop their understanding of millions by building knowledge of the pattern of times ten in the base ten system on the place value chart (4.NBT.1).  They recognize that each sequence of three digits is read as hundreds, tens, and ones followed by the naming of the corresponding base thousand unit (thousand, million, billion)."

EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_7_Exploring_measurement_with_multiplication/index.html>Module_7_Exploring_measurement_with_multiplication</a></p><p>"In this module, students build their competencies in measurement as they relate multiplication to the conversion of measurement units.  Throughout the module, students explore multiple strategies for solving measurement problems involving unit conversion." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_5_Fraction_equivalence_ordering_and_operations/index.html>Module_5_Fraction_equivalence_ordering_and_operations</a></p><p>"In this module, students build on their Grade 3 work with unit fractions as they explore fraction equivalence and extend this understanding to mixed numbers.  This leads to the comparison of fractions and mixed numbers and the representation of both in a variety of models.  Benchmark fractions play an important part in students’ ability to generalize and reason about relative fraction and mixed number sizes.  Students then have the opportunity to apply what they know to be true for whole number operations to the new concepts of fraction and mixed number operations." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_4_Angle_measure_and_plane_figures/index.html>Module_4_Angle_measure_and_plane_figures</a></p><p>"This module introduces points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, as well as the relationships between them.  Students construct, recognize, and define these geometric objects before using their new knowledge and understanding to classify figures and solve problems.  With angle measure playing a key role in the work throughout the module, students learn how to create and measure angles, as well as how to create and solve equations to find unknown angle measures.  In these problems, where the unknown angle is represented by a letter, students explore both measuring the unknown angle with a protractor and reasoning through the solving of an equation.  This connection between the measurement tool and the numerical work lays an important foundation for success with middle-school geometry and algebra.  Through decomposition and composition activities, as well as an exploration of symmetry, students recognize specific attributes present in two-dimensional figures.  They further develop their understanding of these attributes as they classify two-dimensional figures." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_6_Decimal_fractions/index.html>Module_6_Decimal_fractions</a></p><p>"This module gives students their first opportunity to explore decimal numbers via their relationship to decimal fractions, expressing a given quantity in both fraction and decimal forms.  Utilizing the understanding of fractions developed throughout Module 5, students apply the same reasoning to decimal numbers, building a solid foundation for Grade 5 work with decimal operations. Previously referred to as whole numbers, all numbers written in the base-ten number system with place value units that are powers of 10 are henceforth referred to as decimal numbers, a set which now includes tenths and hundredths (e.g., 1, 15, 248, 0.3, 3.02, and 24.35)."

As a key area of focus for Grade 4, this module moves slowly but comprehensively to develop students’ ability to reason about the methods and models chosen to solve problems with multi-digit factors and dividends."
