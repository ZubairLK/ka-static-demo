"This module introduces points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, as well as the relationships between them.  Students construct, recognize, and define these geometric objects before using their new knowledge and understanding to classify figures and solve problems.  With angle measure playing a key role in the work throughout the module, students learn how to create and measure angles, as well as how to create and solve equations to find unknown angle measures.  In these problems, where the unknown angle is represented by a letter, students explore both measuring the unknown angle with a protractor and reasoning through the solving of an equation.  This connection between the measurement tool and the numerical work lays an important foundation for success with middle-school geometry and algebra.  Through decomposition and composition activities, as well as an exploration of symmetry, students recognize specific attributes present in two-dimensional figures.  They further develop their understanding of these attributes as they classify two-dimensional figures." EngageNY
