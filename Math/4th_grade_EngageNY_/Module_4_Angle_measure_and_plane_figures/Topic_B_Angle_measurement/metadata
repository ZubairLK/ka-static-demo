Topic B includes lessons 5-8.  "Use a circular protractor to understand a 1-degree angle as 1/360 of a turn. Explore benchmark angles using the protractor.  Use varied protractors to distinguish angle measure from length measurement.  Measure and draw angles. Sketch given angle measures, and verify with a protractor.  Identify and measure angles as turns and recognize them in various contexts." EngageNY
