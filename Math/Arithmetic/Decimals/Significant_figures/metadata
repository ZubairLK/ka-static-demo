There is a strong temptation in life to appear precise, even when you are aren't accurate.   If you  precisely measure one dimension of a carpet to be 3.256 meters and eyeball the other dimensional to be "roughly 2 meters", can you really claim that the area is  6.512 square meters (3.256 x 2)?  Isn't that a little misleading?  

This tutorial gets us thinking about this conundrum and gives us the best practices that scientists and engineers use to not mislead each other.
