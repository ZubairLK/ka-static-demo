"Specify and partition a whole into equal parts, identifying and counting unit fractions using concrete models.  Specify and partition a whole into equal parts, identifying and counting unit fractions by folding fraction strips.  Specify and partition a whole into equal parts, identifying and counting unit fractions by drawing pictorial area models.  Represent and identify fractional parts of different wholes."

"Partition a whole into equal parts and define the equal parts to identify the unit fraction numerically.  Build non-unit fractions less than one whole from unit fractions.  Identify and represent shaded and non-shaded parts of one whole as fractions.  Represent parts of one whole as fractions with number bonds.  Build and write fractions greater than one whole using unit fractions."  EngageNY

"Compare fractions with the same numerator pictorially.  Compare fractions with the same numerator using <, >, or =, and use a model to reason about their size.  Partition various wholes precisely into equal parts using a number line method."  EngageNY

"Recognize and show that equivalent fractions have the same size, though not necessarily the same shape.   Recognize and show that equivalent fractions refer to the same point on the number line.  Generate simple equivalent fractions by using visual fraction models and the number line.  Express whole numbers as fractions and recognize equivalence with different units.  Express whole number fractions on the number line when the unit interval is 1.  Decompose whole number fractions greater than 1 using whole number equivalence with various models.  Explain equivalence by manipulating units and reasoning about their size."  EngageNY

"Place fractions on a number line with endpoints 0 and 1.  Place any fraction on a number line with endpoints 0 and 1.  Place whole number fractions and fractions between whole numbers on the number line.  Practice placing various fractions on the number line.  Compare fractions and whole numbers on the number line by reasoning about their distance from 0.  Understand distance and position on the number line as strategies for comparing fractions."

"Compare unit fractions by reasoning about their size using fraction strips.  Compare unit fractions with different sized models representing the whole.  Specify the corresponding whole when presented with one equal part.  Identify a shaded fractional part in different ways depending on the designation of the whole."  EngageNY
