Topic E includes lessons 20-27.  "Recognize and show that equivalent fractions have the same size, though not necessarily the same shape.   Recognize and show that equivalent fractions refer to the same point on the number line.  Generate simple equivalent fractions by using visual fraction models and the number line.  Express whole numbers as fractions and recognize equivalence with different units.  Express whole number fractions on the number line when the unit interval is 1.  Decompose whole number fractions greater than 1 using whole number equivalence with various models.  Explain equivalence by manipulating units and reasoning about their size."  EngageNY
