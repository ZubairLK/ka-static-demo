"In this module, students extend and deepen Grade 2 practice with equal shares to understanding fractions as equal partitions of a whole (2.G.3).  Their knowledge becomes more formal as they work with area models and the number line.  Throughout the module, students have multiple experiences working with the Grade 3 specified fractional units of halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and eighths.  To build flexible thinking about fractions, students are exposed to additional fractional units such as fifths, ninths, and tenths." EngageNY
