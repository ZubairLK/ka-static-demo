"This module begins the year by building on students’ fluency with addition and their knowledge of arrays.  In Topic A, students initially use repeated addition to find the total from a number of equal groups (2.OA.4).  As students notice patterns, they let go of longer addition sentences in favor of more efficient multiplication facts (3.OA.1).  Lessons in Topic A move students’ Grade 2 work with arrays and repeated addition a step further by developing skip-counting rows as a strategy for multiplication.  Arrays become a cornerstone of the module.  Students use the language of multiplication as they understand what factors are and differentiate between the size of groups and the number of groups within a given context.  In this module, the factors 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and  10 provide an entry point for moving into more difficult factors in later modules."  EngageNY
