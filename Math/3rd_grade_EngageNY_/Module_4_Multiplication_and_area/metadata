"In this module, students explore area as an attribute of two-dimensional figures and relate it to their prior understandings of multiplication.  In Grade 2, students partitioned a rectangle into rows and columns of same-sized squares and found the total number by both counting and adding equal addends represented by the rows or columns (2.G.2, 2.OA.4)."
