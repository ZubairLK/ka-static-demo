Topic C includes lessons 10-17.  "Decompose quadrilaterals to understand perimeter as the boundary of a shape.  Measure side lengths in whole number units to determine the perimeter of polygons.  Explore perimeter as an attribute of plane figures and solve problems.  Determine the perimeter of regular polygons and rectangles when whole number measurements are unknown.  Solve word problems to determine perimeter with given side lengths.  Use string to measure the perimeter of various circles to the nearest quarter inch.  Use all four operations to solve problems involving perimeter and unknown measurements."  EngageNY
