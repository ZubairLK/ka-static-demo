"Decompose once to subtract measurements including three-digit minuends with zeros in the tens or ones place.  Decompose twice to subtract measurements including three-digit minuends with zeros in the tens and ones places.  Estimate differences by rounding and apply to solve measurement word problems.  Estimate sums and differences of measurements by rounding, and then solve mixed word problems." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Topic_A_Time_measurement_and_problem_solving/index.html>Topic_A_Time_measurement_and_problem_solving</a></p><p>Topic A includes lessons 1-5.  "Explore time as a continuous measurement using a stopwatch.   Relate skip-counting by fives on the clock and telling time to a continuous measurement model, the number line.  Count by fives and ones on the number line as a strategy to tell time to the nearest minute on the clock.  Solve word problems involving time intervals within 1 hour by counting backward and forward using the number line and clock.  Solve word problems involving time intervals within 1 hour by adding and subtracting on the number line."

"Add measurements using the standard algorithm to compose larger units once.  Add measurements using the standard algorithm to compose larger units twice.  Estimate sums by rounding and apply to solve measurement word problems."

"Round two-digit measurements to the nearest ten on the vertical number line.  Round two- and three-digit numbers to the nearest ten on the vertical number line.  Round to the nearest hundred on the vertical number line." EngageNY

"Build and decompose a kilogram to reason about the size and weight of 1 kilogram, 100 grams, 10 grams, and 1 gram.  Develop estimation strategies by reasoning about the weight in kilograms of a series of familiar objects to establish mental benchmark measures.  Solve one-step word problems involving metric weights within 100 and estimate to reason about solutions.  Decompose a liter to reason about the size of 1 liter, 100 milliliters, 10 milliliters, and 1 milliliter.  Estimate and measure liquid volume in liters and milliliters using the vertical number line.  Solve mixed word problems involving all four operations with grams, kilograms, liters, and milliliters given in the same units." EngageNY
