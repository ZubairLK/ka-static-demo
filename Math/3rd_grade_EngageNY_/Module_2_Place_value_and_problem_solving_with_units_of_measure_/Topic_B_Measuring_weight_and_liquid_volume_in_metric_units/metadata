Topic B includes lessons 6-11.  "Build and decompose a kilogram to reason about the size and weight of 1 kilogram, 100 grams, 10 grams, and 1 gram.  Develop estimation strategies by reasoning about the weight in kilograms of a series of familiar objects to establish mental benchmark measures.  Solve one-step word problems involving metric weights within 100 and estimate to reason about solutions.  Decompose a liter to reason about the size of 1 liter, 100 milliliters, 10 milliliters, and 1 milliliter.  Estimate and measure liquid volume in liters and milliliters using the vertical number line.  Solve mixed word problems involving all four operations with grams, kilograms, liters, and milliliters given in the same units." EngageNY
