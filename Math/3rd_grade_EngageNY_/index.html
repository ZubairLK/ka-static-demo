Their knowledge becomes more formal as they work with area models and the number line.  Throughout the module, students have multiple experiences working with the Grade 3 specified fractional units of halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and eighths.  To build flexible thinking about fractions, students are exposed to additional fractional units such as fifths, ninths, and tenths." EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_4_Multiplication_and_area/index.html>Module_4_Multiplication_and_area</a></p><p>"In this module, students explore area as an attribute of two-dimensional figures and relate it to their prior understandings of multiplication.  In Grade 2, students partitioned a rectangle into rows and columns of same-sized squares and found the total number by both counting and adding equal addends represented by the rows or columns (2.G.2, 2.OA.4)."

In Topic A, students initially use repeated addition to find the total from a number of equal groups (2.OA.4).  As students notice patterns, they let go of longer addition sentences in favor of more efficient multiplication facts (3.OA.1).  Lessons in Topic A move students’ Grade 2 work with arrays and repeated addition a step further by developing skip-counting rows as a strategy for multiplication.  Arrays become a cornerstone of the module.  Students use the language of multiplication as they understand what factors are and differentiate between the size of groups and the number of groups within a given context.  In this module, the factors 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and  10 provide an entry point for moving into more difficult factors in later modules."  EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_7_Geometry_and_measurement_word_problems/index.html>Module_7_Geometry_and_measurement_word_problems</a></p><p>"The final module of the year offers students intensive practice with word problems, as well as hands-on investigation experiences with geometry and perimeter."  EngageNY</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Module_3_Multiplication_and_division_with_units_of_0_1_6_9_and_multiples_of_10/index.html>Module_3_Multiplication_and_division_with_units_of_0_1_6_9_and_multiples_of_10</a></p><p>"This module builds directly on students’ work with multiplication and division in Module 1 .  At this point, Module 1 instruction coupled with fluency practice in Module 2 has students well on their way to meeting the Grade 3 fluency expectation for multiplying and dividing within 100 (3.OA.7).  Module 3 extends the study of factors from 2, 3, 4,  5, and 10 to include all units from  0 to 10 , as well as multiples of 10 within 100.  Similar to the organization of Module 1 , the introduction of new factors in Module 3 spreads across topics.  This allows students to build fluency with facts involving a particular unit before moving on.  The factors are sequenced to facilitate systematic instruction with increasingly sophisticated strategies and patterns." EngageNY</p></div>
