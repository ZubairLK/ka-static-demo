"This module builds directly on studentsâ€™ work with multiplication and division in Module 1 .  At this point, Module 1 instruction coupled with fluency practice in Module 2 has students well on their way to meeting the Grade 3 fluency expectation for multiplying and dividing within 100 (3.OA.7).  Module 3 extends the study of factors from 2, 3, 4,  5, and 10 to include all units from  0 to 10 , as well as multiples of 10 within 100.  Similar to the organization of Module 1 , the introduction of new factors in Module 3 spreads across topics.  This allows students to build fluency with facts involving a particular unit before moving on.  The factors are sequenced to facilitate systematic instruction with increasingly sophisticated strategies and patterns." EngageNY
