How do you find the area under a curve?  What about the length of any curve? Is there a way to make sense out of the idea of adding infinitely many infinitely small things?  Integral calculus gives us the tools to answer these questions and many more.  Surprisingly, these questions are related to the derivative, and in some sense, the answer to each one is the opposite of the derivative.
