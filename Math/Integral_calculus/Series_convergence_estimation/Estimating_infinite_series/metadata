We've spent a lot of time thinking about whether a series converges or diverges.  But, even if we can determine that a series converges, how can we figure out what it converges to?  This tutorial will show techniques of estimating what a series converges to, and for determining how good our estimates are.  This is super useful because most series can't be precisely evaluated (like we were able to do with infinite geometric series).
