This will help us on our journey to find a formal definition for the derivative.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Rational_functions_differentiation/index.html>Rational_functions_differentiation</a></p><p>Solve problems involving the derivatives of rational functions. For example, find f'(1) of f(x)=(x+2)/(x-3).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Proofs_for_the_derivatives_of_e_and_ln_x_/index.html>Proofs_for_the_derivatives_of_e_and_ln_x_</a></p><p>The derivatives of eˣ and ln(x) may be simple, but proving them is a different story. Learn all about it here.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Derivative_as_a_limit/index.html>Derivative_as_a_limit</a></p><p>The derivative is actually a special kind of limit! This is yet another important stop on our continuing journey towards a formal definition of the derivative.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Derivatives_capstone/index.html>Derivatives_capstone</a></p><p>Review your function differentiation skills with some challenge problems.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Differentiability/index.html>Differentiability</a></p><p>The derivative of a function isn't necessarily defined at every point. Learn about the conditions for the derivative to exist, and specifically about how continuity fits with this story (spoiler: for a function to be differentiable at a point it must be continuous at that point, but the other way isn't necessary).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Review_Advanced_differentiation/index.html>Review_Advanced_differentiation</a></p><p>Review your knowledge of the advanced differentiation topics with some challenge problems.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Quotient_rule/index.html>Quotient_rule</a></p><p>The quotient rule says that the derivative of the quotient f(x)/g(x) is [f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)]/g²(x). This helps us find the derivative of a function which is a quotient of two other, more basic, functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Polar_curve_differentiation/index.html>Polar_curve_differentiation</a></p><p>Find tangents to polar curves.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Using_the_formal_definition_of_derivative/index.html>Using_the_formal_definition_of_derivative</a></p><p>Learn how we can use their formal definition in order to find the derivatives of specific functions.

Implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of y with respect to x, even in such equations.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Basic_differentiation_rules/index.html>Basic_differentiation_rules</a></p><p>If you ever tried to find derivatives using their formal definition, you probably know how tedious that may be. Fortunately, we have ways for finding derivatives much quicker, using differentiation rules! Make your first steps in this fascinating world by working with the more basic rules. For example, the derivative of [f(x)+g(x)] is f'(x)+g'(x), and the derivative of k⋅f(x) is k⋅f'(x).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Logarithmic_differentiation/index.html>Logarithmic_differentiation</a></p><p>In logarithmic differentiation, we find the derivative of the natural log of a function instead of the derivative of the function itself. It may surprise you, but this can sometimes actually be easier than regular differentiation, if not the only available option. For example, finding the derivative of xˣ.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Derivative_as_slope_of_tangent_line/index.html>Derivative_as_slope_of_tangent_line</a></p><p>One way of thinking about the derivative (of a function at a point) is as the slope of the tangent line (to the function's graph at that point). Get comfortable with this approach here.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Chain_rule/index.html>Chain_rule</a></p><p>The chain rule says that the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)) is f'(g(x))⋅g'(x). This helps us find the derivative of a composite function. It may be slightly hard to grasp, but its importance cannot be overstated!</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Implicit_differentiation_advanced_examples_/index.html>Implicit_differentiation_advanced_examples_</a></p><p>Tackle some more advanced problems of implicit differentiation.

That's pretty amazing. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is just as surprising.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Review_Basic_differentiation/index.html>Review_Basic_differentiation</a></p><p>Review your understanding of basic differentiation rules and your knowledge of the derivatives of common functions with some challenge problems.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Derivative_as_a_function/index.html>Derivative_as_a_function</a></p><p>This may blow your mind, but the derivative of a function is a function in itself! Get comfortable in thinking about the derivative as a function that is separate from, but tightly related to, its original function.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Formal_definition_of_derivative/index.html>Formal_definition_of_derivative</a></p><p>There are two ways to define the derivative of function f at point x=a. The formal definition is the limit of [f(a+h)-f(x)]/h as h approaches 0, and the alternative definition is the limit of [f(x)-f(a)]/(x-a) as x approaches a. Make introduction with these two definitions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Higher_order_derivatives_parametric_vector_valued_functions_/index.html>Higher_order_derivatives_parametric_vector_valued_functions_</a></p><p>Learn how to find the second derivatives (and any higher-order derivative) of parametric and vector-valued functions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Radical_functions_differentiation/index.html>Radical_functions_differentiation</a></p><p>Solve problems involving the derivatives of radical functions.

An answer to this question lies just right here.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Trigonometric_functions_differentiation/index.html>Trigonometric_functions_differentiation</a></p><p>Solve problems involving the derivatives of trigonometric functions. For example, find h'(π) of h(x)=sin(x²-4x+1).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Derivative_as_instantaneous_rate_of_change/index.html>Derivative_as_instantaneous_rate_of_change</a></p><p>One way of thinking about the derivative is as instantaneous rate of change. This is quite incredible because rate of change is usually found over a period of time, and not at an instant. Get comfortable with this approach here.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Inverse_trig_functions_differentiation/index.html>Inverse_trig_functions_differentiation</a></p><p>Implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivatives of arcsin(x), arccos(x), and arctan(x).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Exponential_functions_differentiation/index.html>Exponential_functions_differentiation</a></p><p>Solve problems involving the derivatives of exponential functions.

Get comfortable working with this relationship.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Disguised_derivatives/index.html>Disguised_derivatives</a></p><p>Equipped with knowledge about the derivatives of all common functions, evaluate some limits that represent various derivatives.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Taking_derivatives_skill_checks/index.html>Taking_derivatives_skill_checks</a></p><p>Test your understanding of derivatives.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Sine_cosine_derivatives/index.html>Sine_cosine_derivatives</a></p><p>The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).
