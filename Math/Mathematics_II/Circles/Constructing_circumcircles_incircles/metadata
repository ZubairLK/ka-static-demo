In our study of triangles, we spent a decent amount of time think about incenters (the intersections of the angle bisectors) and circumcenters (the intersections of the perpendicular bisectors).  We'll now leverage this knowledge to actually construct circle inscribed and circumscribed about a triangle using only a compass and straightedge (actually virtual versions of them).
