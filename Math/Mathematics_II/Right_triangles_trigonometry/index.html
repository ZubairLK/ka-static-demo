It's simple.  It's beautiful.  It's powerful.

In this tutorial, we will cover what it is and how it can be used.  We have another tutorial that gives you as many proofs of it as you might need.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Pythagorean_theorem_proofs/index.html>Pythagorean_theorem_proofs</a></p><p>The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most famous ideas in all of mathematics.  This tutorial proves it.  Then proves it again... and again... and again.  More than just satisfying any skepticism of whether the Pythagorean theorem is really true (only one proof would be sufficient for that), it will hopefully open your mind to new and beautiful ways to prove something very powerful.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Solving_for_a_side_in_a_right_triangle_using_the_trigonometric_ratios/index.html>Solving_for_a_side_in_a_right_triangle_using_the_trigonometric_ratios</a></p><p>Learn how to find a side length in a right triangle when given one side length and one acute angle.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Special_right_triangles/index.html>Special_right_triangles</a></p><p>We hate to pick favorites, but there really are certain right triangles that are more special than others.  In this tutorial, we pick them out, show why they're special, and prove it!  These include 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles (the numbers refer to the measure of the angles in the triangle).</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p><a href=Pursuit_of_a_Pythagorean_proof_optional_/index.html>Pursuit_of_a_Pythagorean_proof_optional_</a></p><p>An exploration which allows the reader to choose his or her own path to a proof of the Pythagorean theorem.​</p></div>
