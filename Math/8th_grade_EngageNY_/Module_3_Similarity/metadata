"The experimental study of rotations, reflections, and translations in Module 2 prepares students for the more complex work of understanding the effects of dilations on geometrical figures in their study of similarity in Module 3. They use similar triangles to solve unknown angle, side length and area problems. Module 3 concludes with revisiting a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem from the perspective of similar triangles.
