"In Module 2, students study congruence by experimenting with rotations, reflections, and translations of geometrical figures. Their study of congruence culminates with an introduction to the Pythagorean Theorem in which the teacher guides students through the “square-within-a-square” proof of the theorem. Students practice the theorem in real-world applications and mathematical problems throughout the year." EngageNY
