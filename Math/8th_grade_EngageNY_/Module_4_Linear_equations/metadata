"In Module 4, students use similar triangles learned in Module 3 to explain why the slope of a line is well-defined. Students learn the connection between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations as they develop ways to represent a line by different equations (y = mx + b, y â€“ y1 = m, etc.). They analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations. The equation of a line provides a natural transition into the idea of a function explored in the next two modules."
