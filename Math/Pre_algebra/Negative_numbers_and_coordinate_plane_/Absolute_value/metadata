You'll find absolute value absolutely straightforward--it is just the "distance from zero". If you have a positive number, it is its own absolute value. If you have a negative number, just make it positive to get the absolute value. As you see as you develop mathematically, this idea will eventually extended to more contexts and dimensions, so super important that you understand this core concept now.
