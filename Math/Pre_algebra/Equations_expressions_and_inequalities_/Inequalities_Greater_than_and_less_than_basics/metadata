Equality is usually a good thing, but the world is not a perfect place.  No matter how hard we try, we can't help but compare one thing to another and realize how unequal they may be.

This tutorial gives you the tools to do these comparisons in the mathematical world (which we call inequalities).  You'll become familiar with the "greater than" and "less than symbols" and learn to use them.
