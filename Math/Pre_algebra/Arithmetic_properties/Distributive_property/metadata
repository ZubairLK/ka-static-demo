The distributive property is an idea that shows up over and over again in mathematics.  It is the idea that 5 x (3 + 4) = (5 x 3) + (5 x 4).  If that last statement made complete sense, no need to watch this tutorial.  If it didn't or you don't know why it's true, then this tutorial might be a good way to pass the time :)
