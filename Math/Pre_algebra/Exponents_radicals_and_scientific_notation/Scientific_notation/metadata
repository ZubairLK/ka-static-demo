Scientists and engineers often have to deal with super huge (like 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) and super small numbers (like 0.0000000000532) .  How can they do this without tiring their hands out?  How can they look at a number and understand how large or small it is without counting the digits?  The answer is to use scientific notation.

If you come to this tutorial with a basic understanding of positive and negative exponents, it should leave you with a new appreciation for representing really huge and really small numbers!
