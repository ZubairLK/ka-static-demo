You're already familiar with finite geometric series, but you don't want the summation to stop!!  What happens if you keep adding?  The terms are getting small fast!  Can it be that the sum of an infinite number of rapidly shrinking terms can be finite!  Yes, often times it can!  Mind-blowing!  Stupendous!
