Scientists and engineers often deal with super huge numbers like 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and super small numbers like 0.0000000000532. How can they do this without tiring their hands out?  How can they look at a number and understand how large or small it is without counting the digits? The answer to both questions: scientific notation.
